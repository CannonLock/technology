Notes: Additional “urgent” releases may be scheduled for the 4th Tuesday of each month. The Testing date is when acceptance testing will be scheduled for releasable packages; if a package is added after this date, it may not be possible to schedule adequate testing time, thereby forcing it into the next release.</br>

## OSG Investigations Team


### Last Week
- OSG-Connect wanted some project renames, done, but waiting on verification.


### This Week
- GRACC host cert expired, but that only affects backups so everything is still online
- WCLG wants some info on missing accounting, but they are slow on finalizing their own accounting.  But it looks like it is now finished.
- Derek will be at PEARC next week and will be presenting
