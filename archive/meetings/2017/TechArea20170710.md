Notes: Additional “urgent” releases may be scheduled for the 4th Tuesday of each month. The Testing date is when acceptance testing will be scheduled for releasable packages; if a package is added after this date, it may not be possible to schedule adequate testing time, thereby forcing it into the next release.  


## OSG Software Team

-   Two weeks until August development freeze
-   Major LCMAPS VOMS plugin issues plaguing multiple sites, causing extensive downtime


### Discussions

-   The root cause of the LCMAPS VOMS segfaults appear to be due to memory issues in the proxy verification module. BrianB hopes to have a fix by the end of the day.


### Support Update

-   Clemson, IIT, UConn (BrianL) - LCMAPS VOMS plugin issue above


## OSG Release Team

### Discussions

-    Operations will be adopting a more flexible release schedule, at least for changes transparent to the user
-    Cert update incoming; Edgar will help test it while Suchandra is at PEARC. In the future, it may make more sense to test cert packages in an automated fashion \minus; perhaps with `rpmdiff`.
