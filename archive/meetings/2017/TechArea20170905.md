Notes: Additional “urgent” releases may be scheduled for the 4th Tuesday of each month. The Testing date is when acceptance testing will be scheduled for releasable packages; if a package is added after this date, it may not be possible to schedule adequate testing time, thereby forcing it into the next release.

### Discussions

New 8.7 Condor build might have to be punted to October.  We might still release a new 8.6 this month -- have to look at OSG's demands to see if it's worth releasing.


### Support Update

Some issues with Florida -- Derek to investigate.

### Discussions

Will need extra help for testing.  Nebraska will help test the Globus update for 3.4, but need a 3.3 site to test the 3.3 updates -- should contact osg-sites.

Suchandra may test gridftp-hdfs but Matyas still needs to debug & promote.
