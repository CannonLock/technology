### Discussion

Dropping software support from the LCMAPS VOMS tickets. Separate out the LCMAPS VOMS tickets in the weekly meetings


### Support Update

-   `condor_ssh_to_job` (Edgar) - Having back and forth with ToddT to get it working in the OSG
-   UConn (BrianL) - jobs going over memory and ignoring `PREEMPT_IF` memory expression due to the bulk of the usage being in shared memory. `CGROUP_MEMORY_LIMIT_POLICY = hard` should enforce RSS + shared mem
