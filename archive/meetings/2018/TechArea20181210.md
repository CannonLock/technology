## OSG Investigations Team

What is StashCache & XCache?  StashCache is a special configuration of XCache, which is a special configuration of XRootD.

-   Automated authfile generation for Origins is upcoming.
-   Developed load testing for stashcache using [Locust](https://locust.io/).  Follow up with I2
-   Re-organize caches behind redirectors to split load with I2 caches.  Nebraska and KC cache first.  Need to register the redirector with the cache discovery methods.
-   Perfsonar mesh for the StashCache nodes, or at least nearby nodes.

Done Last Week:
-   HTCondor-TCP stats packaging for the submit nodes (SchedDs)
-   StashCP udpates, run from everywhere!

### Ongoing

-   [GRACC Project](https://opensciencegrid.atlassian.net/projects/GRACC)
-   [StashCache Project](http://opensciencegrid.org/docs/data/stashcache/overview/)
