### Support Update

-   AGLT2 (BrianL): high load on some worker nodes (`ls /tmp hangs`) with some ATLAS jobs using 100% of swap. Spent last week sorting out login issues.
-   AMNH (BrianL): Successfully set up job submission to the AMNH Slurm cluster.
    There's a BLAHP/Slurm issue that Suchandra had workaround hacks for that we'll need to investigate.
-   LIGO (Mat): GSI-OpenSSH hanging issue, gave them some debugging instructions.
-   Topology (Carl): Copy-paste error of downtime created some issues for our consumers. We will be adding a validation check for CreatedTime.
-   UFL (Derek): Missing January accounting records due to a Slurm update that broke our database queries.
    Bockjoo has a workaround that has temporarily solved this issue but we'd like to solve this more sustainably (SOFTWARE-1588).
