### Discussion

We would like to get HTCondor 8.8 into mainline but the default auth removes `DAEMON_LIST` so it could break current
installations of HTCondor


## OSG Investigations Team

-   cvmfs-authz-helper (cvmfs-x509-helper) - Testing continues
-   HTCondor-CE Gratia probe installed and running at Nebraska slurm. Records look ok.  Need to perform a "checklist" of attributes to make sure we are correct.
    - https://opensciencegrid.atlassian.net/browse/SOFTWARE-3748
-   CMS asked for application specific attributes to be added to the XRootD Detailed Monitoring Collector.
-   GRACC accounting taskforce - Tasking!!!


### Backburner

-   Working with operations investigating OAuth with co-manage.  Waiting on co-manage (Wisconsin?!?!)


### Future

-   Lots of GRACC questions: <https://opensciencegrid.atlassian.net/browse/SOFTWARE-3642>
