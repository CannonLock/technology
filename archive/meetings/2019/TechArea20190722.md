### Discussion

We would like to get HTCondor 8.8 into mainline but the default auth removes `DAEMON_LIST` so it could break current installations of HTCondor  


## OSG Investigations Team
-   HTCondor-CE Gratia probe installed and running at Nebraska slurm. Records look ok.  Need to perform a "checklist" of attributes to make sure we are correct.  
    -   <https://opensciencegrid.atlassian.net/browse/SOFTWARE-3748>
    -   Found we are not collecting system time.
-   CMS asked for application specific attributes to be added to the XRootD Detailed Monitoring Collector.
-   GRACC accounting taskforce - Tasking!!!  See meeting on Wed.
-   Networking wants a tool to "go back in time".


### Backburner

-   Working with operations investigating OAuth with co-manage.  Waiting on co-manage (Wisconsin?!?!)


### Future

-   Lots of GRACC questions: <https://opensciencegrid.atlassian.net/browse/SOFTWARE-3642>


### Ongoing

-   [GRACC Project](https://opensciencegrid.atlassian.net/projects/GRACC)
