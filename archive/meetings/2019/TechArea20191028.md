-   BNL (Derek): Belle II had disabled their Gratia probes but after re-enabling them the historical records were not still picked up. Still investigating.
-   UCSD (Edgar): had been assisting a user with their environment on a local submit host but we think it would be a good idea to have them sign up with OSG Connect.

### Discussion

-   We receive feedback from community testing emails infrequently but tend to still have to contact specific people for testing
    -   Brian Lin proposed adding the ATLAS and CMS Tier-2 email lists to perhaps get stake holders to encourage admins to do some testing


## OSG Investigations

-   Simple validation of xrootd-monitoring-collector passed.  
    -   Data collected for production validation, now to correlate the 2 sources, collector and remote xrootd server.  Difficult step.
-   Working with Brian (and Frank?) on GRACC changes.
-   Update of GRACC ES, which may require some development changes.  Hopefully updating this week.
-   **DONE** NSF science bucket metadata for GRACC development.  
    -   **TODO** Need to discuss with the RCF team about field of science updates
    -   **TODO** Add science bucket on a dashboard
-   Helping osg-connect with SciTokens installation across submit hosts (Thanks mat for the RPM)

### Discussion

None this week
