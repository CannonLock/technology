    - Does the product work?
- Incorrect or out of date instructions
- Steps that may be particularly conducive to software or default configuration as a solution
- Lack of clarity or any other confusion you may have

[layout](/documentation/writing-documentation#document-layout) guidelines, as well as correct spelling and grammar.
