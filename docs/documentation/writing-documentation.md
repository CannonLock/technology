Tips for Writing Software Documentation
=======================================

Writing Procedural (Step-by-Step) Instructions
----------------------------------------------

- Title the procedure with the user goal, usually starting with a gerund; e.g.:

    **Installing the Frobnosticator**

- Number all steps (as opposed to using bullets)

- List steps in order in which they are performed

- Each step should begin with a single-line instruction in plain English, in command form; e.g.:
    3. Make sure that the Frobnosticator configuration file is world-writable

- If the means of carrying out the instruction is unclear or complex, include clarification, ideally in the form of a working example; e.g.:
  ```
  chmod a+x /usr/share/frobnosticator/frob.conf
  ```

- Put clarifying information in separate paragraphs within the step

- Put critical information about the **whole** procedure in one or more paragraphs before the numbered steps

- Put supplemental information about the **whole** procedure in one or more paragraphs after the numbered steps

- Avoid pronouns when writing technical articles or documentation e.g., `install foo` rather than `install it`.
