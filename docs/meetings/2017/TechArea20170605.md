Notes: Additional “urgent” releases may be scheduled for the 4th Tuesday of each month. The Testing date is when acceptance testing will be scheduled for releasable packages; if a package is added after this date, it may not be possible to schedule adequate testing time, thereby forcing it into the next release.  


## OSG Software Team

-   [Singularity build](https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/singularity-2.2.1-3.el7) in EPEL stable so we can exclude it from OSG 3.4.0
