|-------------- |------------------ |-------------- |---------- |---------------- |
| 3.4.1 / 3.3.26 | 2017-06-26         | 2017-07-03     | 2017-07-11 | Independence Day |

Notes: Additional “urgent” releases may be scheduled for the 4th Tuesday of each month. The Testing date is when acceptance testing will be scheduled for releasable packages; if a package is added after this date, it may not be possible to schedule adequate testing time, thereby forcing it into the next release.  


## OSG Software Team

-   Dev freeze next Monday
-   Started transitioning hosted CEs to LCMAPS VOMS plugin last week
-   RHEL VMU tests working for the time being even though our RHEL subscription ended. Erin rebuilt RHEL7 exec node, working on building RHEL7 VM image using Aaron's subscription
-   `xrootd-cmstfc` (contrib) fails to build for EL7, need help with CMake to place libs in `/usr/lib64` rather than `/usr/lib/`
