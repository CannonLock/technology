Notes: Additional “urgent” releases may be scheduled for the 4th Tuesday of each month. The Testing date is when acceptance testing will be scheduled for releasable packages; if a package is added after this date, it may not be possible to schedule adequate testing time, thereby forcing it into the next release.

### Support Update

-   FIT (BrianL): CE can't contact backend schedd/pool

-   UWash (BrianL): jobs held due to "non-existent route or job route limit"
