Notes: Additional “urgent” releases may be scheduled for the 4th Tuesday of each month. The Testing date is when acceptance testing will be scheduled for releasable packages; if a package is added after this date, it may not be possible to schedule adequate testing time, thereby forcing it into the next release.

-   CTSC (BrianL) - Worked locally with student to set up test CE for testing the blahp
-   JINR (BrianL) - blahp failures due to issue with ASCII chars, finally got a stacktrace
-   LBNL (BrianL) - issues with the blahp may have been due to misconfiguration
-   Taiwan (BrianL) - idle jobs on CE, likely a basic configuration issue
-   UCSD (BrianL) - helped Terrence troubleshoot condor not starting after issues with a full disk (resolved by restarting and waiting)
-   GLOW (Edgar & Derek) - Helping figure out why GLOW is not running as much as OSG. (mostly edgar)
