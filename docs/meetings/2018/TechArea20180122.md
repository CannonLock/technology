## OSG Software Team

-   Tickets will be opened with edg-mkgridmap/GUMS sites to transition to LCMAPS VOMS authentication  
    -   Instructions need to be improved for sites still on 3.3 (<https://ticket.grid.iu.edu/35830>)
    -   [gWMS site tester](http://test-012.t2.ucsd.edu/rsv/) results
-   GCT: Seeing some external contributions and we're ramping up on the first release. Globus references and docs need to be fixed.
-   OSG 3.4.7:  
    -   HTCondor issues with 8.6.9 and 8.7.6, will await the next release
    -   Status on RSV? It's nearly ready, there's one ticket that needs to review before being built
-   Doc Focus 2 is scheduled for 1pm CST on Feb 1


### Discussion

-   gWMS site tester timing out because it competes with actual job. Edgar to run a slightly different probe using Condor-G (or condor<sub>ping</sub>?)
-   We need to communicate with the rest of the GCF that we will be taking point on documentation
-   Derek and Edgar will attend the doc focus afternoon (Edgar will start and end ~1hr earlier)


### Support Update

-   display.opensciencegrid.org (Carl) - errors are showing because of empty data from GRACC; trying to replicate
-   OK (Marian) - working on XrootD PID file placement.
