## OSG Software Team

-   15 tickets will be opened with edg-mkgridmap/GUMS sites to transition to LCMAPS VOMS authentication  
    -   There are already instructions for edg-mkgridmap to transition.  
        The timeline we'd like to see is that edg-mkgridmap sites transition by the end of March.
    -   GUMS sites are trickier:
        -   If they attach their GUMS config, MAKE SURE THEIR DB USERNAME/PASS ARE REDACTED
        -   Find out what GUMS clients they may have: CE, gridftp, xrootd, dcache, bestman. The first three all support LCMAPS VOMS auth, dcache and bestman2 do not. They cannot turn off their GUMS until they transition off of dcache/bestman2.
        -   Let Carl know of any attached GUMS configs and the output of \`rpm -q osg-gums-config\`.
-   GCT: Frank Scheiner registered Gitbook/ReadTheDocs orgs but hasn't worked on the documentation other than that. Let's get started on making the transition from Globus to GCF/GCT. I can help setup GitHub docs.
-   OSG 3.4.7  
    -   HDFS tested at Nebraska, looks good over the weekend
    -   Can we sneak HTCondor into this release?
-   GOC tickets should be closed in favor of JIRA tickets if the user agrees to it ([GOC vs JIRA](/policy/software-support#goc-vs-jira)):
