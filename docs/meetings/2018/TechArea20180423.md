### Support Update

Caltech (Marian) - set up and registered the LIGO StashCahe origin server
LIGO (Edgar) - some sites cannot access their frame files
FNAL (Derek) - Joel Snow wanted to use rsync against repo for a local mirror but it wasn't working. They're happily using the UNL repo now.

## OSG Investigations Team

GOC Transition is going to dominate the Investigations Team's time over the next couple of weeks.   I want to give general status of the transitions we are participating in.  So, I will give a couple of states:  

1.  Have not started
2.  In development - Could be provisioning hardware, adapting software, installing software&#x2026;
3.  Ready for testing - In a state where it can be tested by the consumers
4.  Deployed

| Service               | Status            |
|--------------------- |----------------- |
| OIM                   | In Development    |
| OASIS                 | Ready for testing |
| CVMFS                 | Ready for testing |
| Software Repo         | Deployed          |
| OSG Display           | Ready for testing |
| StashCache Redirector | Deployed          |
| OSG Collector         | Ready for testing |

Changes:  

-   StashCache Redirector: Testing -> Deployed.  Origins are reporting to the new redirector.
-   Software Repo (waiting on DNS): Testing -> Deployed.  External site is already using it as an rsync mirror (GOC one broke)
-   OIM Projects and VOs are working for GRACC.  Topology is untested.

### Ongoing
