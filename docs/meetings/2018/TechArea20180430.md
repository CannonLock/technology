## OSG Software Team

-   Triage duty  
    -   Everyone should be subscribed to [software-support@opensciencegrid.org](mailto:software-support@opensciencegrid.org) plus have GGUS and Freshdesk accounts
    -   As we transition support, we need to also watch the new mailing list and [Freshdesk](https://support.opensciencegrid.org/helpdesk/tickets) using the "My Group Tickets, all but unresolved and closed" filter
    -   Note: Freshdesk tickets aren't currently public. CC's only see comments after they've been added.
-   Office hours: same times this week but plan to cut down on the frequency next week
-   We are deactivating non-OSG staff JIRA accounts in the new cloud-hosted JIRA instance

### Discussion

-   Action item (BrianL): Add a banner to ticket to inform users about Freshdesk
-   Action item (Derek): Investigate how mailing lists/other ticket systems work with Freshdesk
-   Action item (Suchandra): Checking to see if you can reverse ticket comment order in Freshdesk

## OSG Investigations Team

GOC Transition is going to dominate the Investigations Team's time over the next couple of weeks.   I want to give general status of the transitions we are participating in.  So, I will give a couple of states:  

1.  Have not started
2.  In development - Could be provisioning hardware, adapting software, installing software&#x2026;
3.  Ready for testing - In a state where it can be tested by the consumers
4.  Deployed

| Service               | Status            |
|--------------------- |----------------- |
| OIM                   | In Development    |
| OASIS                 | Ready for testing |
| CVMFS                 | Ready for testing |
| Software Repo         | Deployed          |
| OSG Display           | Deployed          |
| StashCache Redirector | Deployed          |
