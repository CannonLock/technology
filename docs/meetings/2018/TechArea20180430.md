-   Triage duty  
    -   Everyone should be subscribed to [software-support@opensciencegrid.org](mailto:software-support@opensciencegrid.org) plus have GGUS and Freshdesk accounts
    -   As we transition support, we need to also watch the new mailing list and [Freshdesk](https://support.opensciencegrid.org/helpdesk/tickets) using the "My Group Tickets, all but unresolved and closed" filter
    -   Note: Freshdesk tickets aren't currently public. CC's only see comments after they've been added.
-   Office hours: same times this week but plan to cut down on the frequency next week


### Discussion

None this week  


### Support Update

-   Caltech (Marian) - set up and registered the LIGO StashCahe origin server
-   LIGO (Edgar) - some sites cannot access their frame files
-   FNAL (Derek) - Joel Snow wanted to use rsync against repo for a local mirror but it wasn't working. They're happily using the UNL repo now.

## OSG Investigations Team

GOC Transition is going to dominate the Investigations Team's time over the next couple of weeks.   I want to give general status of the transitions we are participating in.  So, I will give a couple of states:  

1.  Have not started
2.  In development - Could be provisioning hardware, adapting software, installing software&#x2026;
3.  Ready for testing - In a state where it can be tested by the consumers
4.  Deployed

| Service               | Status            |
|--------------------- |----------------- |
| OIM                   | In Development    |
| OASIS                 | Ready for testing |
| CVMFS                 | Ready for testing |
| Software Repo         | Deployed          |
| OSG Display           | Ready for testing |
| StashCache Redirector | Deployed          |
| OSG Collector         | Ready for testing |

Changes:  

-   StashCache Redirector: Testing -> Deployed.  Origins are reporting to the new redirector.
-   Software Repo (waiting on DNS): Testing -> Deployed.  External site is already using it as an rsync mirror (GOC one broke)
-   OIM Projects and VOs are working for GRACC.  Topology is untested.
