## OSG Investigations Team

GOC Transition is going to dominate the Investigations Team's time over the next couple of weeks.   I want to give general status of the transitions we are participating in.  So, I will give a couple of states:  

1.  Have not started
2.  In development - Could be provisioning hardware, adapting software, installing software&#x2026;
3.  Ready for testing - In a state where it can be tested by the consumers
4.  Deployed

| Service               | Status   |
|--------------------- |-------- |
| OIM                   | Deployed |
| OASIS                 | Deployed |
| CVMFS                 | Deployed |
| Software Repo         | Deployed |
| OSG Display           | Deployed |
| StashCache Redirector | Deployed |
| OSG Collector         | Deployed |

Changes:  

-   OSG Collector: Social campaign for the OSG collector has started!  Look for freshdesk tickets.
-   OIM: New OIM is up and running.  DNS change was on Thursday, as scheduled.

**Done with transitions!?!**
