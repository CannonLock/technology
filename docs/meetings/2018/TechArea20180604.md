## OSG Investigations Team

### GOC Transitions

**Done with transitions!?!**  

We are all but done with the transition of services from IU.  There are still a few items on our list:

-  (Ongoing) Getting sites to transition to the new HTCondor collector
-  Minor hiccup with OSG-WN tarball in OASIS home directory.  Still investigating.

And a few longer term goals:

-  Most services are in puppet.  Just need to put the finishing touches on it.  For example, the changes made in the last week with all of the OIM, Ticket,... redirections.
-  Most services are in check_mk (active monitoring), but need to add specific tests.  For example, we check that HTTP(s) is responding to requests, but we would like to make sure it is responding with correct info.

### Presentations

Gave a StashCache presentation at the GPN annual meeting.  Went over very well.  Highlighted the science drivers for StashCache.

### Ongoing

-   [GRACC Project](https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/projects/GRACC/)
-   [StashCache Project](https://opensciencegrid.github.io/StashCache/)


### Discussions

Derek: There is a command that users can run to verify that they're sending ads to the new central collector
