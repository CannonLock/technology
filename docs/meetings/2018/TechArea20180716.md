### Discussions

-   (Derek) AI: Will speak with admins about moving IPs out of Anvil so that we don't have central collector downtime
-   (Edgar) AI: gWMS factories would like to generate factory entries based off information in CRIC, which will populate some of its data off of the central collector. Edgar will provide a list of info that he believe may be auto-discoverable on the CE to be advertised back to the central collector
