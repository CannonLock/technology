## OSG Investigations Team


### Operations

-   Moving hosts from Anvil cloud host at Nebraska for Anvil downtime
    - Lots of hosts moved already.  Hopefully, without any noticable downtime
    - GRACC head node is moving today (data nodes were moved 2 weeks ago).  May see small downtimes (but will be up at the end of the day)
    - Was able keep the same IPs for the central collectors, CE's automatically picked up the (non)change and reported to the new collectors.
-   Need to start operations meetings again.

TODO:  

-   Discussion of SLA's, availability metrics
-   Puppetize: ~~Collectors~~, GRACC
