## OSG Investigations Team

In Progress:  

-   XRootD documentation and docker overhaul is ongoing.  Organized in StashCache in collaboration with Slate and NRP (PRP) collegues.
-   Shepherding the xrootd plugins through the release process.  
    -   xrootd-TPC - contrib
    -   xrootd-macaroons - contrib
    -   xrootd-scitokens - release
    -   x509-scitokens-issuer - contrib
-   Discussions with with Internet2 to place StashCache in connection points. Waiting on GeoIP issues to be worked out.
-   (Still ongoing) The repo server is going to move, once again.  But there should be no noticable differences.  If there is, then we failed.
-   Topology-itb server certificate failed last week.  Fixed by Mat, but underlying issue is that puppet is failing on topology-itb, or turned off.


### Ongoing
