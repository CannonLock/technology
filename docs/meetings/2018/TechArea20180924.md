Reminder: topology and especially downtime updates should be considered high priority.
Please watch the [topology GitHub repo](https://github.com/opensciencegrid/topology).

Carl is working on automation but is out all this week so it might take a while before it's ready.


### Discussions

none


### Support Update

- Edgar working on a HTCondor-CE ticket for Rice but needs help; Marian may be able to help
- Marian helped MIT with XRootD set up to support HTTPS; hopefully successful;
    were able to upgrade 3 of 6 data server but they have a mix of OSG 3.3 and 3.4
  - OASIS Replica production update ran into issues due to Kernel problems so downtime lasted longer than expected. Should be up and running now.


## OSG Release Team



### Discussions




## OSG Investigations Team

In Progress:  

-   Shepherding the xrootd plugins through the release process.  
    -   xrootd-TPC - contrib
    -   xrootd-macaroons - contrib
    -   xrootd-scitokens - release
    -   x509-scitokens-issuer - contrib
- StashCache documentation overhaul!!!
- StashCache packaging is also being modified to include auth, and less copy-paste!
- We will start sending CMS XRootD traffic to the WLCG file transfer monitoring service (MONIT), in development.

-   (Still ongoing) The repo server is going to move, once again.  But there should be no noticable differences.  If there is, then we failed.

-   [StashCache Project](http://opensciencegrid.org/docs/data/stashcache/overview/)
