In Progress:  

-   Shepherding the xrootd plugins through the release process.  
    -   xrootd-TPC - contrib
    -   xrootd-macaroons - contrib
    -   xrootd-scitokens - release
    -   x509-scitokens-issuer - contrib
- StashCache documentation overhaul!!!
- StashCache packaging is also being modified to include auth, and less copy-paste!
- We will start sending CMS XRootD traffic to the WLCG file transfer monitoring service (MONIT), in development.

-   (Still ongoing) The repo server is going to move, once again.  But there should be no noticable differences.  If there is, then we failed.

-   [StashCache Project](http://opensciencegrid.org/docs/data/stashcache/overview/)


### Last Week
