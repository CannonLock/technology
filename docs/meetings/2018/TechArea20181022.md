### Discussion

-   AI (BrianL) - Will pick volunteers for GlideinWMS/XRootD VMU tests. Kick off osg-test VMU tests.
-   AI (Mat) - Punt 3.4.20 tickets, try to sneak a new build of StashCache into 3.4.19, and untag GlideinWMS 3.4 from upcoming
-   AI (Edgar) - will test GlideinWMS 3.4.1 when it's ready in osg-testing
-   AI (Carl) - Condor prerelease builds + VMU tests


### Support Update

Test frontend (Edgar) - Fixed. The problem was due to GlideinWMS scripts (a CMS frontend using OSG scripts).
This class of problem will go away with the built-in GlideinWMS Singularity support.
