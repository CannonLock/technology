## OSG Investigations Team

Last week:

-   Derek at SC18 conference this week gives talks about StashCache
-   Scheduled network outage last Thursday @UNL went smooth without OSG services interruption hosted by UNL (had spare hosts up/swapped before that)
-   Work on critical fix for XRootD causing StashCache segfault, deployed at SYR and running fine since then
-   I2 StashCaches (NY, UChicago, KS) now in OASIS after BNL Stratum 1 CMVFS upgrade


### Ongoing
