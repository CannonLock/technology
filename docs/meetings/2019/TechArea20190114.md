## OSG Software Team

-   3.4.23  
    -   AI (Carl): Release gratia-probe 1.18.28+
    -   AI (BrianB, Derek, Marian, Mat): Various StashCache 1.0 tickets
    -   AI (Mat): Update gsi-openssh version
    -   AI (BrianB): Review BrianL's xrootd-lcmaps pull request
-   XCache container due at the end of the month
-   Next doc focus 2018-01-24
-   Potential student hire at UW-Madison


### Discussion

-   A default XCache image will serve as the base for StashCache and ATLAS XCache
-   Organize XCache Dockerfiles in a single repository either under different directories or branches


### Support Update

-   AGLT2 (BrianL): high load on some worker nodes (`ls /tmp hangs`) with some ATLAS jobs using 100% of swap
-   Colorado (BrianL): Some FIFE jobs are failing to fetch the worker node hostname causing job failure. As a result, FNAL is blacklisting Colorado.
-   FNAL (BrianL): Accounting group issues when submitting jobs through a CE. The same user can show up under the CE UID domain or the local batch system UID domain
-   Georgia Tech (Derek, Edgar): They need some help registering a Stash cache and updating their registration to support XCache 1.0. Edgar is working with them to get an IGTF InCommon certificate.

### Discussion

-   AI (Carl): Manually test HDFS 2.6 on EL6 packages, especially upgrades from EL6.
-   AI (BrianL, TimT): Write HDFS release notes to indicate that this update is only intended to support mounting HDFS via FUSE with EL6 clients.
    It is not intended for updating name nodes, data nodes, XRootD, or GridFTP hosts. Instead we recommend updating to EL7.


## OSG Investigations Team

-   Re-organize caches behind redirectors to split load with I2 caches. Nebraska and KC cache first. Need to register the redirector with the cache discovery methods.
-   Perfsonar mesh for the StashCache nodes, or at least nearby nodes.

Done last week:  

-   HTCondor-TCP stats packaging for the submit nodes (SchedDs)
-   Monitoring working set size of StashCache caches now at bottom of kibana dashboard.
-   StashCP udpates, now can be installed by `pip`


### Ongoing

-   [GRACC Project](https://opensciencegrid.atlassian.net/projects/GRACC)
-   [StashCache Project](http://opensciencegrid.org/docs/data/stashcache/overview/)


### Discussions

AI (Edgar): Coordinate with BrianL and Mat for k8s-ization of StashCache origin and hosted CEs
