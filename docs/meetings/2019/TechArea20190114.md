## OSG Investigations Team

-   Re-organize caches behind redirectors to split load with I2 caches. Nebraska and KC cache first. Need to register the redirector with the cache discovery methods.
-   Perfsonar mesh for the StashCache nodes, or at least nearby nodes.

Done last week:  

-   HTCondor-TCP stats packaging for the submit nodes (SchedDs)
-   Monitoring working set size of StashCache caches now at bottom of kibana dashboard.
-   StashCP udpates, now can be installed by `pip`
