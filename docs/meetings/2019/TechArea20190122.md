### Support Update

-   AGLT2 (BrianL): high load on some worker nodes (`ls /tmp hangs`) with some ATLAS jobs using 100% of swap
-   Colorado (BrianL): Tanya's group is using the hostname for blackhole detection, not sure why the experiment itself is testing for the hostname.
-   FNAL (BrianL): Accounting group issues are being resolved in the job router. The fix will make it into 8.6 and 8.8
-   Georgia Tech (Derek, Edgar): They need some help registering a Stash cache and updating their registration to support XCache 1.0. Edgar is working with them to get an IGTF InCommon certificate.

## OSG Investigations Team

-   OSG Ops meeting next week, investigations is deeply involved in ops.
-   Lots of changes to the perfsonar infrastructure software.  Should be in "testing mode" this week.
-   Lots of performance tests by the experiments that may lead to xrootd bug reports which we will be facilitating.
-   GRACC updates for hosted CE gratia probe fixes.  Will need to do some data analaytics.

-   Need an update - Re-organize caches behind redirectors to split load with I2 caches. Nebraska and KC cache first. Need to register the redirector with the cache discovery methods.
-   Need an update - Perfsonar mesh for the StashCache nodes, or at least nearby nodes.


Done last week:  

-   Some more SciTokens


### Ongoing

-   [GRACC Project](https://opensciencegrid.atlassian.net/projects/GRACC)
-   [StashCache Project](http://opensciencegrid.org/docs/data/stashcache/overview/)


### Discussions

AI (Edgar): Coordinate with BrianL and Mat for k8s-ization of StashCache origin and hosted CEs
