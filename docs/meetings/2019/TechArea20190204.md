### Support Update

-   AGLT2 (BrianL): high load on some worker nodes (`ls /tmp hangs`) with some ATLAS jobs using 100% of swap. Happening less frequently now
-   Clemson and UERJ (Mat, BrianL): Uncovered an issue in our HTCondor-CE installation doc (separating the job queue log from SPOOL doesn't work).  
    Reverted that documentation for now and we're discussing details with the HTCondor team.
-   Purdue (Marco): Glideins ignoring SIGTERM because the `pbs_script.sh` wrapper script created by the BLAHP is trapping signals and not forwarding them
