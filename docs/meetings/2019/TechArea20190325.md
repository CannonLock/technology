## OSG Investigations Team

-   PerfSonar collectors = DONE
-   Lots of GRACC questions at HOW, will likely take development
-   Moving forward with new SciTokens setup at OSG-Connect.  Need to coordinate switchover.
-   What would it take to run HTCondor-CE gratia probe on a slurm cluster?  Will start investigating with Nebraska.
-   StashCache paper accepted to PEARC, will likely disappear into a bunker to write.
-   Lots of good press about StashCache / Xcache at HOW.  Want to build off of that.
-   Investigating check_mk probe that will check the status of hosted-ce's.
