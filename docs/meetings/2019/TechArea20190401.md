    -   XCache documentation updates need review (multiple)
    -   GlideinWMS 3.4.3 maybe?
    -   CCTools 7.0.11 maybe? (Carl)


### Discussion

- Edgar may be able to take GlideinWMS ticket but might have found another bug
  so needs to do some patching?  Will check to see if the new version fixes the
  bug.



### Support Update

- Carl still working on Florida accounting issue; hopes to be done later this week

## OSG Investigations Team

-   Lots of GRACC questions: https://opensciencegrid.atlassian.net/browse/SOFTWARE-3642
-   Moving forward with new SciTokens setup at OSG-Connect.  Need to coordinate switchover.
-   Derek is disappearing into a bunker to write paper.
-   What would it take to run HTCondor-CE gratia probe on a slurm cluster?  Will start investigating with Nebraska, next week.
-   Investigating check_mk probe that will check the status of hosted-ce's.  Direct query of glideinwms factory seems dubious.


### Ongoing

-   [GRACC Project](https://opensciencegrid.atlassian.net/projects/GRACC)
-   [StashCache Project](http://opensciencegrid.org/docs/data/stashcache/overview/)
