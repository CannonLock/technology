### Discussion

-   AI (TimT): Determine the number of times we've promoted packages to testing to see if we need a new mailing list for the community testing announcements


## OSG Investigations Team

-   Moving forward with new SciTokens setup at OSG-Connect.  Need to coordinate switchover.  Daily poking of osg-connect team.  Admittidely, they seem un-motivated.  Will motivate with... snacks?
-   Derek's current status: In bucker, writing.
-   Investigating check<sub>mk</sub> probe that will check the status of hosted-ce's.  Direct query of glideinwms factory seems dubious.

### Future
-   Lots of GRACC questions: <https://opensciencegrid.atlassian.net/browse/SOFTWARE-3642>
-   What would it take to run HTCondor-CE gratia probe on a slurm cluster?  Will start investigating with Nebraska, next week.
