## OSG Investigations Team

-   Lots of GRACC questions: <https://opensciencegrid.atlassian.net/browse/SOFTWARE-3642>
-   Moving forward with new SciTokens setup at OSG-Connect.  Need to coordinate switchover.
-   Derek is disappearing into a bunker to write paper.
-   What would it take to run HTCondor-CE gratia probe on a slurm cluster?  Will start investigating with Nebraska, next week.
-   Investigating check<sub>mk</sub> probe that will check the status of hosted-ce's.  Direct query of glideinwms factory seems dubious.
