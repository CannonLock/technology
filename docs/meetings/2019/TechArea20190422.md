We promote approximately 180 packages to testing over the year. That works out to roughly 3 packages every 4 working days.  


## OSG Investigations Team

-   Derek is busy preparing for a presentation at UNL about using the OSG as a research platform
-   XRootD workshop will be held in France in 6-8 weeks
-   Some resources in topology don't have an APEL normalization factor set in topology, causing issues with APEL numbers.  
    We have opened tickets with the relevant site admins.


### Future

-   Lots of GRACC questions: <https://opensciencegrid.atlassian.net/browse/SOFTWARE-3642>
-   What would it take to run HTCondor-CE gratia probe on a slurm cluster?  Will start investigating with Nebraska, next week.
