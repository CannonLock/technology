### Discussion

-   AI (Marian, John T): Should be able to test XCache by noon Wed
-   AI (TimT): Request a mailing list for community testing, populate it with Topology admin contacts, and write an introductory email


## OSG Investigations Team

-   XRootD workshop will be held in France in 6-8 weeks
-   Some resources in topology don't have an APEL normalization factor set in topology, causing issues with APEL numbers.  
    We have opened tickets with the relevant site admins.
-   Accounting audit is beginning in collaboration with ATLAS.


### Future

-   I would like the investigations team to make a thrust helping Ops with monitoring.  Lots of issues with things that are failing.  And who is watching the watchers (GRACC alert email wasn't being sent... watch the watchers)?
-   Lots of GRACC questions: <https://opensciencegrid.atlassian.net/browse/SOFTWARE-3642>
-   What would it take to run HTCondor-CE gratia probe on a slurm cluster?  Will start investigating with Nebraska, next week.


### Ongoing

-   [GRACC Project](https://opensciencegrid.atlassian.net/projects/GRACC)
-   [StashCache Project](http://opensciencegrid.org/docs/data/stashcache/overview/)
