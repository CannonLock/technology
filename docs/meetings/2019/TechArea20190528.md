## OSG Software Team

-   OSG 3.5 planning to start this week: <https://opensciencegrid.atlassian.net/issues/?jql=labels%20%3D%203.5.0>
-   Hosted-CE:  
    -   Initial script for managing WN software/data from the CE host in the Operation team's hands
    -   AI (Mat): send email to Ops and UChicago admins to discuss design of managing CE configuration from a central host
-   Blahp unification status?
-   AI (Mat): IceCube is interested in using the GLOW origin
-   AI (Mat):


### Discussion

-   What are the limits on the RHEL developer license? TimT said unlimited VMs on a single host
-   Discussion about GLOW stash cache/origin on k8s


### Support Update

-   NET2 (Carl): Continuing work on the custom SGE probe to fix missing accounting records
-   Purdue (Marco): privileged singularity is not accepting signals even after dropping privs.  
    Suggested solution is to use unprivileged singularity.
-   SuperMIC (Edgar): Troubleshooting issues with CVMFS
-   SWT2 (BrianL): the blahp does not refresh proxies after 24h on WNs and this has bitten ATLAS.  
    Have a fix that worked for SWT2 included in a new build.
-   Syracuse (BrianL): troubleshooting issues with factory ops about the OSG VO's inability to fully utilize their idle cores
-   UCSD (Diego): Troubleshooting issues with using chirp within Singularity containers.  
    Jaime has suggested using the python client.
-   Atlas (Derek): Update multiple sites in the WLCG accounting portal (NET2 and OU): https://ggus.eu/index.php?mode=ticket_info&ticket_id=141350

## OSG Investigations Team

-   Working with Operations on monitoring.  Added Hosted-CE's monitoring.  Continuing to refine.  Way too noisy.  Need to fix alerts.
-   Also working with operations investigating OAuth with co-manage.
-   Accounting audit is continuing in collaboration with ATLAS.  Pretty much done on our end.  Accounting portal appears updated.
-   Adapting LIGO style cvmfs + singularity.  Ready for testing.
-   Creating cvmfs + scitokens repo to start testing scitokens enabled stashcache.
-   Factory monitoring to GRACC.


### Future

-   Lots of GRACC questions: <https://opensciencegrid.atlassian.net/browse/SOFTWARE-3642>
-   What would it take to run HTCondor-CE gratia probe on a slurm cluster?  On pause.


### Ongoing

-   [GRACC Project](https://opensciencegrid.atlassian.net/projects/GRACC)
