## OSG Software Team

-   OSG 3.5 planning to start this week: <https://opensciencegrid.atlassian.net/issues/?jql=labels%20%3D%203.5.0>
-   Hosted-CE:  
    -   Initial script for managing WN software/data from the CE host in the Operation team's hands
    -   AI (Mat): send email to Ops and UChicago admins to discuss design of managing CE configuration from a central host
-   Blahp unification status?
-   AI (Mat): IceCube is interested in using the GLOW origin
-   AI (Mat):


### Discussion

-   What are the limits on the RHEL developer license? TimT said unlimited VMs on a single host
-   Discussion about GLOW stash cache/origin on k8s


### Support Update

-   NET2 (Carl): Continuing work on the custom SGE probe to fix missing accounting records
-   Purdue (Marco): privileged singularity is not accepting signals even after dropping privs.  
    Suggested solution is to use unprivileged singularity.
-   SuperMIC (Edgar): Troubleshooting issues with CVMFS
-   SWT2 (BrianL): the blahp does not refresh proxies after 24h on WNs and this has bitten ATLAS.  
    Have a fix that worked for SWT2 included in a new build.
-   Syracuse (BrianL): troubleshooting issues with factory ops about the OSG VO's inability to fully utilize their idle cores
-   UCSD (Diego): Troubleshooting issues with using chirp within Singularity containers.  
    Jaime has suggested using the python client.
