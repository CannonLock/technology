## OSG Investigations Team

-   Working with operations investigating OAuth with co-manage.  Waiting on co-manage (Wisconsin?!?!)
-   Accounting audit is continuing in collaboration with ATLAS.  Pretty much done on our end.  Accounting portal appears updated.  PDF's look wrong.  They will not be updated, but they look wrong even for the previous bad data.
-   Adapting LIGO style cvmfs + singularity.  Ready for testing.
-   (DONE) Creating cvmfs + scitokens repo to start testing scitokens enabled stashcache.
-   cvmfs-authz-helper (cvmfs-x509-helper) will be built this week.  Pending pull request to fix issues discovered through testing.


### Future

-   Lots of GRACC questions: <https://opensciencegrid.atlassian.net/browse/SOFTWARE-3642>
-   What would it take to run HTCondor-CE gratia probe on a slurm cluster?  On pause.
