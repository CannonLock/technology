## OSG Software Team

-   OSG 3.5 packages reviewed: <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WNk8F5XRQSJw3mwTFejJBLNbrQptdUxpWpZ0UEu-4MI/edit?usp=sharing>
-   XCache:  
    -   AI (BrianL): Get ATLAS/CMS XCache RPM packaging in this week
    -   AI (BrianL): Add XCache integration tests to the container CI
    -   AI (BrianL, Marian): Put together slides for the XRootD container/packaging/monitoring presentation
-   Hosted-CE:  
    -   Initial script for managing WN software/data from the CE host in the Operation team's hands
    -   AI (Mat): elaborate on plans to manage remote submission host patches/config from a central host
-   Blahp unification: CHTC git repo and mirroring to GitHub complete. Working through HTCondor build issues.
-   AI (Derek): Review Gratia probe PRs (<https://github.com/opensciencegrid/gratia-probe/pulls>)
-   AI (Mat): Give IceCube access to the GLOW origin
-   Madison ITB CE host certificates will be updated this week


### Discussion

-   AI (BrianL): Create ticket for IceCube/GLOW origin VO work
-   AI (BrianL): Talk to FNAL, factory folks about OSG 3.4 support lifetime (due to dropping EL6 support in OSG 3.5)


### Support Update

-   ATLAS (Derek): Accounting audit continues.
-   CMS (Edgar): Told CMS sites that they can use Let's Encrypt certs for their CEs but there are issues. The CERN factory doesn't have LE CAs installed but we control the host so we can install them. Pilot jobs are running ok but SAM tests and PHEDeX transfers are failing. Vanderbilt is paying DigiCert per host certificate, which may be a potential alternative to InCommon and Let's Encrypt.
-   GLOW (BrianL): Some user jobs are being held in IIT startd's with the message "missing http plugin"
-   Syracuse (BrianL): troubleshooting why their condor pool negotiator isn't matching their whole node jobs

## OSG Investigations Team

-   Working with operations investigating OAuth with co-manage.  Waiting on co-manage (Wisconsin?!?!)
-   Accounting audit is continuing in collaboration with ATLAS.  Pretty much done on our end.  Accounting portal appears updated.  PDF's look wrong.  They will not be updated, but they look wrong even for the previous bad data.
-   Adapting LIGO style cvmfs + singularity.  Ready for testing.
-   (DONE) Creating cvmfs + scitokens repo to start testing scitokens enabled stashcache.
-   cvmfs-authz-helper (cvmfs-x509-helper) will be built this week.  Pending pull request to fix issues discovered through testing.


### Future

-   Lots of GRACC questions: <https://opensciencegrid.atlassian.net/browse/SOFTWARE-3642>
-   What would it take to run HTCondor-CE gratia probe on a slurm cluster?  On pause.


### Ongoing

-   [GRACC Project](https://opensciencegrid.atlassian.net/projects/GRACC)
