-   AI (Derek): Review Gratia probe PRs (<https://github.com/opensciencegrid/gratia-probe/pulls>)
-   AI (Mat): Waiting on Benedikt to verify access to the GLOW origin server
-   AI( BrianL, TimT): Madison ITB currently broken due to a pool password misconfiguration
-   Next doc focus July 25 (1:30-5:30pm CDT)


### Discussion

-   Edgar is also working on setting up a GlideinWMS frontend for BNL.
    This may be a Kubernetes setup or just a regular old VM.
-   Due to commas in some certificate DNs (looking at you, UCSD) this breaks the ability to run `condor_off` from GlideinWMS frontends against pilot startds.
    Marco has potential fixes involving using `condor_mapfile` instead of `GSI_DAEMON_NAME`.


### Support Update

-   GLOW (BrianL): Some user jobs are being held in IIT startd's with the message "missing http plugin"
-   Let's Encrypt (Mat): A site asked for Let's Encrypt instructions for EL6. We don't have Let's Encrypt instructions for EL6 we know how to do this, it just needs to be documented
-   SWT2 (Carl): We've got a Gratia probe pull request in for a Slurm v18 fix; we're also investigating a strange dependency on the OSG user-vo-map that shouldn't be there anymore
-   Syracuse (BrianL): troubleshooting why their condor pool negotiator isn't matching their whole node jobs. Working with the Flightworthy team.
