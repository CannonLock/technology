## OSG Software Team

-   OSG 3.4.33  
    -   Across the board failures with xrootd-lcmaps-1.7.2-1 needs investigation (<http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/tests/20190726-1559/results.html>)
    -   AI (Brian): Stash Origin changes; osg-xrootd support
    -   AI (Carl): Support new MySQL versions in the Slurm Gratia probes
-   OSG 3.5  
    -   AI (Carl): Start preparing the OSG 3.5 repositories (<https://opensciencegrid.org/technology/release/new-release-series/>).  
        Take notes so that we can generalize the document moving forward.
    -   AI (Mat): Upstream OSG GCT patches so we can drop GCT packages from OSG 3.5
-   AI (Edgar): Add chkconfig lines to `gwms-renew-proxies` (<https://opensciencegrid.atlassian.net/browse/SOFTWARE-3758>)
-   New documentation explaining the Topology resource retirement process:  
    <https://opensciencegrid.org//operations/services/topology-contacts-data/#retiring-resources>


### Discussion

-   AI (BrianL): Add Diego to VMU mailing list and start introducing him to the VMU test suite
-   AI (BrianL): Review Gratia tickets and let Carl know if he can move forward with building the RPM
-   There was some discussion about whether it's a good idea to continue removing resources from Topology. Namely if there are resources that are revived after being retired, there can be a discontinuity in records if the resource is revived under a different site and resource name. There are technical solutions (using `git log -S` to search through commit history) and process solutions that we can develop to address this potential problem.


### Support Update

-   Brown (Marian): working on XRootD issue (AAA CMS problems); still in progress
-   GGUS ticket w/ Doug Johnson about using Let's Encrypt with LVS; resulting in JIRA doc tickets
