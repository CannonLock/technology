### Discussion

None this week  


## OSG Investigations Team

-   CMS requested some changes to xrootd monitoring.  Spurred many other changes which are just finishing up.
-   Working with operations on new, better monitoring of CVMFS exporters.  LIGO failed undetected for a while.  Now fixed, but need better alerting on what ended up being a "WARNING" that should have been a failure.


### Backburner

-   Working with operations investigating OAuth with co-manage.  Waiting on co-manage (Wisconsin?!?!)


### Future

-   Lots of GRACC questions: <https://opensciencegrid.atlassian.net/browse/SOFTWARE-3642>
-   GRACC Taskforce


### Ongoing

-   [GRACC Project](https://opensciencegrid.atlassian.net/projects/GRACC)
-   [StashCache Project](http://opensciencegrid.org/docs/data/stashcache/overview/)
