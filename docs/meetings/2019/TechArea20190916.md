-   OSG 3.4.35/3.5.1  
    -   AI (Diego): Apply bosco override patch to HTCondor 8.8.5 in OSG 3.4 (SOFTWARE-3816)

-   AI (Carl): Issues with Gratia 1.2.10 need to be fixed (SOFTWARE-3737)
-   AI (Edgar): Test the latest Stash Cache image (SOFTWARE-3810)


### Discussion

-   Marco intends to release GlideinWMS 3.5.1 today so that we can test it in OSG 3.4 and 3.5
-   We discussed the short-term plan if we find an issue with the latest Bosco tarballs:
    -   If it's an issue with the compiled code, the tarball needs to be rebuilt
    -   If it's an issue with the scripts, Operations will maintain patches


### Support Update

-   Brown (Marian): They're still working on setting their `storage.xml` properly to join CMS AAA
-   CNAF (Edgar): Troubleshooting authorization failures for authenticated Stash Cache
-   CyVerse (Carl): Running into issues with 32-bit depsolving on upgrade
-   Harvard Medical School (Mat): They can actually get user accounts from Harvard so they don't need to use the OpenID-issued certs
-   LHCb (Derek, Carl): LHCb pilot records show up as `other_egee` but the raw record doesn't contain this anywhere
