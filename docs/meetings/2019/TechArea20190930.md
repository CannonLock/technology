## OSG Software Team

    -   Complete sustainable hosted CE project
    -   Spin up the new OSG submit host for VMU tests
-   Next doc focus Oct 10


### Discussion

-   New "unified" blahp in the upstream HTCondor punted to 8.9.5 due to build difficulties
-   AI (BrianL): Run VMU tests for GlideinWMS 3.6
-   AI (BrianL): Archive the OSG BLAH repository with pointers to the unified htcondor/BLAH fork
-   AI (Carl): Add htcondor/BLAH to the GitHub backup script
-   AI (TimT): Disable AFS/GitHub sync for htcondor/BLAH


### Support Update

-   Brown (Marian): Provided some `site.xml` configuration that the admin needs to apply
-   Caltech (Carl): Some HDFS yum warnings upon upgrade that appear to be due to the local site configuration
-   FNAL (Mat): Gave Steve Timm a patch that hardcodes VOMS server to accept TLS > v1. We don't think we can apply this patch across the board.

### Discussion

None this week


## OSG Investigations

-   Igor has made some progress on deploying XCaches in Azure, Amazon
-   Edgar met with Caltech folks to discuss CMS XCache usage and deployment. They decided that they will deploy k8s pods for SoCal


### Discussion

Edgar mentioned some issues with the submit host setup, including that it's too OSG VO specific and that there is an HTCondor bug that requires a workaround implementation for all UC host certificates
