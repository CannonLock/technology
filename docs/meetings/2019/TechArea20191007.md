### Discussion

None this week  


## OSG Investigations

-   Igor has made some progress on deploying XCaches in Azure, Amazon
-   Edgar met with Caltech folks to discuss CMS XCache usage and deployment. They decided that they will deploy k8s pods for SoCal


### Discussion

Edgar mentioned some issues with the submit host setup, including that it's too OSG VO specific and that there is an HTCondor bug that requires a workaround implementation for all UC host certificates
