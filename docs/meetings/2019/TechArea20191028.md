### Discussion

-   We receive feedback from community testing emails infrequently but tend to still have to contact specific people for testing
    -   Brian Lin proposed adding the ATLAS and CMS Tier-2 email lists to perhaps get stake holders to encourage admins to do some testing


## OSG Investigations

-   Simple validation of xrootd-monitoring-collector passed.  
    -   Working now with Bockjoo on production validation.  Step 1 is making a public test collector
-   Working with Brian (and Frank?) on GRACC changes.
-   Update of GRACC ES, which may require some development changes.  Hopefully updating this week.
-   **DONE** NSF science bucket metadata for GRACC development.  
    -   Need to discuss with the RCF team about field of science updates
-   Attended the RCF meeting to view the new osg-connect user management interface. *neat*
