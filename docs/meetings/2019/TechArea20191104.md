### Discussion

-   Marco is expecting to release a GlideinWMS 3.6.1 RC today
-   OSG security defaults in HTCondor 8.8 for OSG 3.5 are overriding GlideinWMS security defaults. Marco will send an email to the list to discuss config naming conventions.
-   AI (BrianL): We decided to add epel-testing to our nightlies to catch potential issues with EPEL updates before they're released
-   Edgar mentioned that the osg-sw-base container image is really useful and that we should advertise it more widely


### Support Update

-   CERN (BrianL): There's a bug in HTCondor 8.8/8.9 where remote submits set the "Owner" attribute, which prevents job submission if they're mapped to a different owner on the remote host. Will be fixed in the next HTCondor versions. Can be worked around by setting `+Owner = undefined` in the submit file.
-   FNAL (Mat): Steve Timm requested that we disable some cyphers in VOMS
