### Support Update

-   University of Washington (BrianL): Discussed rejoining as an OSG site via Hosted CE. They need to sort outgoing network access on the WNs first.

## OSG Investigations Team

-   Simple validation of xrootd-monitoring-collector passed.  
    -   Data collected for production validation, now to correlate the 2 sources, collector and remote xrootd server.  Difficult step.
-   Working with Brian (and Frank?) on GRACC changes.
    -   Higher priority this week, need to get it done.
-   Update of GRACC ES, which may require some development changes.  Hopefully updating this week.
-   **DONE** NSF science bucket metadata for GRACC development.  
    -   **DONE** Need to discuss with the RCF team about field of science updates
    -   **TODO** Add science bucket on a dashboard
-   Emergency development for scitokens-cpp.  Thanks Mat for the RPM.
