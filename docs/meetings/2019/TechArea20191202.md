## OSG Investigations Team

-   Update of GRACC ES, which may require some development changes.  GRACC ES update is still ongoing.
-   Github actions are cool.
-   (Derek) scitokens-cpp update - Make release.
-   (overdue) Simple validation of xrootd-monitoring-collector passed.  
    -   Data collected for production validation, now to correlate the 2 sources, collector and remote xrootd server.  Difficult step.
