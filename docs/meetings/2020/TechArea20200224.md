    -   AI (Diego): Build XRootD plugins for XRootD 5; RC2 expected in the next ~2 weeks (SOFTWARE-3923)
-   Hosted CE  
    -   AI (Brian): Simplify remote user configuration (SOFTWARE-3960)
    -   AI (Brian): Documentation for OSG Ops
-   GridFTP/GSI transition

### Discussion

-   Next GlideinWMS version expected at the end of this week
-   There were questions about how to separate the XRootD TPC transfers for production from XRootD client transfers. We think that we can get the production transfer data from FTS and subtract that from the data uploaded to get the XRootD client numbers.


### Support Update

-   Florida (BrianL, Derek): Investigating delays in SAM test job startup
-   Nebraska (Diego): Working with admins to transition Nebraska to using XRootD TPC with UCSD
