    -   AI (BrianL): Fix-up email templates and confusing web page for the COManage self-registration process
    -   AI (Edgar): Try out the [self-registration process](https://osg-htc.org/technology/policy/comanage-instructions-user/)

### Discussion

-   AI (Marian): Add BrianL and Andy to discussion about CMS monitoring configuration
-   AI (Diego): Send BrianL local UCSD XRootD standalone and redirector configurations
-   AI (BrianL): Verify non-UW Software Team access to the new OSG Software testing host


### Support Update

-   Caltech, Nebraska (Mat): issue with missing GridFTP logs; we have a package that addresses this issue
-   Notre Dame (Edgar): pilots landing on GPU nodes but not able to use the GPUs; we suspect that it's a wrapper script issue
-   Purdue (Diego): saw 5-6 different issues and saw that the first two accounted for 70% of the errors. The next build of XRootD should solve the first issue and they are increasing the # of TCP connections to address the second.
