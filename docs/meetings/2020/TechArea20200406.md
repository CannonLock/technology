### Discussion

None this week  


### Support Update

-   Caltech, Nebraska (Mat): issue with missing GridFTP logs; we have a package that addresses this issue
-   Notre Dame (Edgar): pilots landing on GPU nodes but not able to use the GPUs; we suspect that it's a wrapper script issue
-   Purdue (Diego): saw 5-6 different issues and saw that the first two accounted for 70% of the errors. The next build of XRootD should solve the first issue and they are increasing the # of TCP connections to address the second.
