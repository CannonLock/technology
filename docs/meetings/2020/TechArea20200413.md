### Support Update

-   Harvester (BrianL): Worked with Harvester developers to troubleshoot an issue where clients failed to connect to the SciTokens test CE. Turned out to be an authentication failure that resulted in an unhelpful client error message.
-   SWT2 (Carl): Continued troubleshooting missing March accounting data.
-   UCSD (Diego): CMS load test transfers were failing due to mismatched checksums. Turned out to be a problem with the source files and HDFS checksums needing to be updated rather than an issue in the transfer itself.
