### Support Update

-   Clarkson, Old Dominion, Portland State (BrianL, Derek): engagements with new Slurm sites. Clarkson and Portland asked for examples of Slurm config "for the OSG", which brought up the question of whether or not we should document these recommendations. We don't want to take on the batch system support burden but this is something that sites are asking for.
-   SWT2 (Derek): Old records are now in the GRACC, waiting for EGI numbers to be updated
