### Support Update

-   Bellarmine (Mat): CE wasn't accepting pilots, turned out to be an old osg-ca-certs version
-   GLOW (Mat): GLOW cache also experienced problems due to the out-of-date osg-ca-certs. Mat will follow-up with Operations to see why check<sub>mk</sub> tests didn't catch this
-   JLab (Edgar): working on security questionnaires so that he can continue setting up services (also has to fill out questionnaires for BNL and FNAL)
