### Discussion

None this week


## OSG Investigations Team

-   Derek was on slate training.
-   GRACC 2 switch was performed today.  Lots of investigation effort to figure out bottlenecks.
-   Lots of communication with XRootD team on TLS + Tokens support.


### Discussion

Edgar's student starts in July to do scale testing for HTTP third party copy. Considering testing authenticated CVMFS but might not be worth doing it until the SciTokens switch (since we'd just have to do it again).
