## OSG Investigations Team

-   OSG Summer School is this week, Derek is participating.
-   XRootD Monitoring Validation is ongoing, and taking significant amount of time (and development / bugfixes)  
    -   Report writing is continuing.
    -   Several patches accepted upstream.
-   CVMFS Singularity Sync is going to start using singularity to create the containers.  Working with interested parties on testing.  
    -   <https://github.com/opensciencegrid/cvmfs-singularity-sync/issues/245>
    -   Found some testing issues.  Working with interested parties, some are slow to respond.  But, Mats is happy.
-   XRootD 5 release and built in OSG.  Preparing TLS configurations for upstreaming, though bugs in xrootd5 are the current issue (watching xcache mailing list).
