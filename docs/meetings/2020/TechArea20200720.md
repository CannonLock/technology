## OSG Software Team

-   OSG 3.5.21  
    -   AI (Diego): Add package NVR table to XRootD plugin tickets and mark RFT (SOFTWARE-4093, SOFTWARE-4137)
            Diego is ready to promote plugins but is waiting on a PR review for xrootd-cmstfc.
    -   AI (Carl): Fix broken cadist links in the initial HTML generation (SOFTWARE-3874)
-   Containers  
    -   AI (Diego): Add `tcmalloc` to XCache containers (SOFTWARE-4166)
    -   AI (BrianL): Add XRootD 5 based XCache image builds (SOFTWARE-4181)
    -   AI (BrianL): Add the ability to build XCache images based on XRootD hotfixes (SOFTWARE-4151)
-   Enterprise Linux 8  
    -   AI (Edgar): Add OpenSSL 1.1.1 support to xrootd-lcmaps (SOFTWARE-4150)  
        -   Testing via XCache not possible because Python bindings for HTCondor (for OSG) are not available yet.  
            Edgar will test using xrootd-standalone
    -   AI (Mat): Add functioning VMU tests for EL8 (SOFTWARE-4072)
        -   Close to working; needs cleanup and PR review.
    -   AI (Mat): Build osg-wn-client tarball (SOFTWARE-4050)
    -   AI (TimT): Release condor for el8 (SOFTWARE-4157)
-   AI (BrianL, Carl): Write design doc for generating pilot records for OSG pilot containers (SOFTWARE-4169)


### Discussion

-   Ongoing storage ticket with Brown; currently it's not OSG-related
    troubleshooting, so it would be better served if it's tracked by CMS
    coordinators.

-   Carl working on moving building container to GitHub actions; this enables
    us to make updates to the `software-base` image and have them trigger
    builds for all descendent images.

-   Edgar will be working on DOMA tasks so will not have time for software
    work.  BrianL and Marian are interested in seeing XCache-related
    documentation that Edgar writes.

-   Edgar has been running an XRootD 5 cache in Sunnyvale.  No problems so far
    but there have been auth issues reported against XRootD 5; BrianL will find
    the GitHub issue so Edgar can test.



### Support Update

-   Edgar:
        - #65322 -- CMU is having difficulties with GridFTP and XRootD.
        - Multi-core pilots at Syracuse not matching; Edgar requests help from
          HTCondor developers, who request additional logs from Syracuse.

-   OSG Summer School is ongoing this week.
-   XRootD Monitoring Validation is ongoing, and taking significant amount of time (and development / bugfixes)  
-   CVMFS Singularity Sync is going to start using singularity to create the containers. Working on testing, see github discussion:  
    -   <https://github.com/opensciencegrid/cvmfs-singularity-sync/issues/245>
    -   More feedback from interested parties and they seem to be happy. Will provide feedback when Derek is back from vacation.
-   XRootD 5 release and built in OSG. Preparing TLS configurations for upstreaming, though bugs in xrootd5 are the current issue (watching xcache mailing list).
    -   organizing presentation on http://gitbhub.com/xrootd/xrootd-k8s-operator on next xcache meeting, IN2P3 folks involved
-   GRACC tape backup broke last week, investigated root cause, turned out to be FNAL issue and fixed by the end of business day on last Friday (operations effort)
