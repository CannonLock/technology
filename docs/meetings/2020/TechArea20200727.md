## OSG Investigations Team

-   Outage of personel last week, Marian was available only on Monday last week
-   Top priority for Deigo and Derek: XRootD Monitoring Validation is ongoing, and taking significant amount of time (and development / bugfixes)
-   CVMFS Singularity Sync is going to start using singularity to create the containers. Working on testing, see github discussion:  
    -   <https://github.com/opensciencegrid/cvmfs-singularity-sync/issues/245>
    -   More feedback from interested parties and they seem to be happy. Will provide feedback when Derek is back from vacation.
-   XRootD 5 release and built in OSG. Preparing TLS configurations for upstreaming.
