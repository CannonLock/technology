## OSG Investigations Team

-   Outage of personel last week, Marian was available only on Monday last week
-   OSG Summer School is ongoing this week.
-   XRootD Monitoring Validation is ongoing, and taking significant amount of time (and development / bugfixes)
-   CVMFS Singularity Sync is going to start using singularity to create the containers. Working on testing, see github discussion:  
    -   <https://github.com/opensciencegrid/cvmfs-singularity-sync/issues/245>
    -   More feedback from interested parties and they seem to be happy. Will provide feedback when Derek is back from vacation.
-   XRootD 5 release and built in OSG. Preparing TLS configurations for upstreaming, though bugs in xrootd5 are the current issue (watching xcache mailing list).  
    -   organizing presentation on <http://gitbhub.com/xrootd/xrootd-k8s-operator> on next xcache meeting, IN2P3 folks involved
-   GRACC tape backup broke last week, investigated root cause, turned out to be FNAL issue and fixed by the end of business day on last Friday (operations effort)
