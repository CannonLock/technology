    -   <https://github.com/opensciencegrid/cvmfs-singularity-sync/issues/245>
    -   More feedback from interested parties and they seem to be happy. Will provide feedback when Derek is back from vacation.
-   Derek needs help with XCache test failures.
-   StashCP Go implementation, may want some help with "evaluating" it as a replacement for stashcp.
