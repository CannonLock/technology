    [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.3981359.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3981359)
-   (No-progress) CVMFS Singularity Sync is going to start using singularity to create the containers. Working on testing, see github discussion:  
    -   <https://github.com/opensciencegrid/cvmfs-singularity-sync/issues/245>
    -   More feedback from interested parties and they seem to be happy. Will provide feedback when Derek is back from vacation.
-   StashCP Go implementation, may want some help with "evaluating" it as a replacement for stashcp.
    - Added cvmfs and check for xrootd functionality.
-   Proactive site monitoring is progressing nicely.  Goal: Present this week
-   GPUs for Folding@Home took some debugging with Mats, but as of this morning, seem to be working great.
