## OSG Investigations Team

-   XRootD Validation document is in "Draft" (Will go out this week)
-   (No-progress) CVMFS Singularity Sync is going to start using singularity to create the containers. Working on testing, see github discussion:  
    -   <https://github.com/opensciencegrid/cvmfs-singularity-sync/issues/245>
    -   More feedback from interested parties and they seem to be happy. Will provide feedback when Derek is back from vacation.
-   StashCP Go implementation, may want some help with "evaluating" it as a replacement for stashcp.  
    -   We have a prototype, who would like to play with it?
-   Proactive site monitoring is progressing nicely.  May present at operations meeting this week.
