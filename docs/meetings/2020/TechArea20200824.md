### Discussion

-   AI (Diego): Continue to build and scitokens packages for EL8.  Contact Jason Patton for software help.
-   AI (Edgar): Build scitokens-issuer for EL8; Derek to merge pull request and make a new release.
-   AI (Edgar): Build osg-gridftp for EL8 since osg-xrootd-standalone is blocked by osg-configure.


### Support Update

-   JLab (BrianL): Walked the admin through setting up an Origin container.
    Topology registration is done; Derek will work on CVMFS.
    JLab will have their own CVMFS endpoint at jlab.opensciencegrid.org, with per-experiment directories.

    - Takeaway: we really need to improve the container so that it's easier to test before Topology registration.
      Our current policy is to require registration before installing the software; we will revisit the policy.

-   Vanderbilt (BrianL): Pilots being killed by the CE after 8 hours (shortly after a proxy renewal). Investigating with the HTCondor team.

-   Edgar: Working on giving UC-Irvine a hosted CE on SLATE.
    Also planning to set up a hosted CE for EXPANSE, but needs to do it without SLATE.

    - Martin Kandes has complained about the install instructions for the worker node client.
      Brian L would like additional information;
      for a hosted CE, the site admin shouldn't have to install worker node client.

-   Marco Mambelli: Planning to release glideinWMS 3.6.3; there is a known issue with a missing dependency in the spec file, which will be fixed in the next release.
    - glideinWMS 3.7.1-rc1 has been released.

-   Tim T: Built Bosco tarballs for EL8 per Ops request for Clemson.

### Discussion

None this week  


## OSG Investigations Team

-   (No-progress) CVMFS Singularity Sync is going to start using singularity to create the containers. Working on testing, see github discussion:  
    -   <https://github.com/opensciencegrid/cvmfs-singularity-sync/issues/245>
    -   More feedback from interested parties and they seem to be happy. Will provide feedback when Derek is back from vacation.
-   StashCP Go implementation is ongoing.
-   Proactive site monitoring is progressing nicely.  Presented last week at Ops, good feedback!
-   UNL's production cache is 5.0.1, with SciTokens enabled.


### Discussion

Tim T discovered that the HTCondor Campus Factory subpackage is broken;
was wondering what it was, and if it was still in use, or required for BOSCO.

Derek (original author) said it was a way for campuses to set up a mini-Glidein Factory.
bosco_cluster has callouts to it but they can be removed with minimal effort.
