### Discussion

None this week  


### Support Update

-   JLab (BrianL): Walked the admin through setting up an Origin container.  
    Takeaway: we really need to improve the container so that it's easier to test before Topology registration.
-   Vanderbilt (BrianL): Pilots being killed by the CE after 8 hours (shortly after a proxy renewal). Investigating with the HTCondor team.
