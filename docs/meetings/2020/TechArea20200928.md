### Discussion

None this week  


## OSG Investigations Team

-   (No-progress) CVMFS Singularity Sync is going to start using singularity to create the containers. Working on testing, see github discussion:  
    -   <https://github.com/opensciencegrid/cvmfs-singularity-sync/issues/245>
    -   More feedback from interested parties and they seem to be happy. Will provide feedback when Derek is back from vacation.
-   StashCP Go implementation is ongoing.
-   Proactive site monitoring is progressing nicely.  Presented last week at Ops, good feedback!
-   UNL's production cache is 5.0.1, with SciTokens enabled.


### Discussion

-   Planning to upgrade XCache redirectors to XRootD 5 and change the config to
    require cache<->redirector commuication to use TLS.
    This will break XRootD 4 caches; almost all caches have been moved to XRootD 5, except for ItalianGrid.
    Edgar will get in touch with them.
