### Discussion

None.



### Support Update

-   Edgar: StashCache at PIC upgraded to the upcoming-fresh version but it's broken for them.  Edgar is troubleshooting; will reach out to XRootD developers for assistance.  The symptom is an SSL permission denied, but the error only shows up in XRootD 5 and goes away when they downgrade.

-   3.9 now in osg-contrib (this includes Python 3 support).
-   Continuing work on 3.7; integrating some work from the recent tokens hackathon.
