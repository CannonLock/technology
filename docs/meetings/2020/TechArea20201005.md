## OSG Software Team

-   Doc focus Oct 22 13:30 - 17:30 CDT
-   Tech team priorities this week: <https://opensciencegrid.atlassian.net/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=19&quickFilter=66>
-   AI (Edgar): merge <https://opensciencegrid.atlassian.net/browse/SOFTWARE-4203>
-   Does XRootD 4.12.5 fix issues found with XRootD 4.12.4?
    -   No; the error seems to affect TPC in the entire 4.12.X series.
        For some reason, nightly VMU tests (which test TPC) have not detected the issue.
        AI (Edgar/Diego): Investigate why VMU tests do not catch this issue.
    -   AI (Edgar/Diego): Report problem to XRootD developers as a GitHub issue.


### Discussion

-   Diego: PR for Python 3 support for SciTokens was merged.
-   AI (Diego): Rebuild XRootD plugins for XRootD 5 (except XRootD-HDFS).
-   AI (Edgar): Build osg-xrootd and x509-scitokens-issuer for EL8, since they are no longer blocked by osg-configure.
    (This is lower priority than XRootD issues mentioned above.)
-   AI (BrianL): Coordinate improvement of cache federation registration process.
-   AI (Mat): Investigate stale URLs in technology docs.

-   TimT:
    -   Encountering build failures for HTCondor on EL8 -- these appear to be random (i.e. rebuilds succeed).
    -   HTCondor-CE tests with HTCondor 8.9.9 are brittle and randomly fail to run.
        BrianL will investigate.

### GlideinWMS

-   Will release 3.6.5, which includes a fix for a bind-mount issue encountered by Marco Mascheroni.


### Support Update

-   Univeristy of Connecticut (BrianL): investigating Blahp segfault with Flightworthy
-   JLab (Derek): Origin host is crashing.  Not necessarily the OSG provided container.
-   Edgar: Continuing to debug issues with XRootD 5 in the CNAF StashCache -- maybe caused by authfile generation.
    Also testing HTCondor 8.9.9 tarballs in the LIGO ITB.
