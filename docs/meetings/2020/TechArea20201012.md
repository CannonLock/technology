## StashCP in Go Presentation

- Due to a number of benefits of Golang as opposed to Python, stashcp is being
  reimplemented in Golang.  This is primarily performance (since it's built for
  concurrency) and ease of installation (since it's a statically linked binary.)

- Some features that have yet to be implemented are:
  - finding the "best" cache
  - stashcp_single

- Timeline of release is "weeks, not months."

- Good documentation and well-commented code is a high priority.

## OSG Software Team

-   Doc focus Oct 22 canceled due to OSG CC\* Workshop Oct 22-23
    Oct 29 is a good cadidate date for a reschedule.
-   CVMFS + EL6 nightly failures currently under investigation with upstream
-   Tech team priorities this week: <https://opensciencegrid.atlassian.net/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=19&quickFilter=66>


### Discussion

-   OSG-Display (the software) is deployed by a Git checkout that is picked up
    by an Apache server.  John Thiltges is working on moving it to Kubernetes.

-   AI (Carl): Deploy repo generation changes to repo-itb.
-   AI (Diego): Build python-scitokens for EL7 and xrootd 5 and plugins for EL8.
-   AI (Edgar): Debug why XRootD fails to start in EL8 VMU tests.

    In time crunch to get EXPANSE going.  They require hosted CEs and use EL8 head nodes.
    All the software should be ready.

-   AI (Mat): Implement token auth for topology.
-   AI (Mat): Update the state of WLCG VO proxy support ticket (SOFTWARE-4113).

### Support Update

-   Univeristy of Connecticut (BrianL): investigating Blahp segfault with Flightworthy
-   JLab (Derek): Origin host is crashing.  Not necessarily the OSG provided container.
-   CNAF (Edgar): Continuing to debug issues with XRootD 5 in the CNAF StashCache &#x2013; maybe caused by authfile generation. Also testing HTCondor 8.9.9 tarballs in the LIGO ITB.
