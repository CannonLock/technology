## OSG Software Team

-   Doc focus Oct 29 1:30pm
-   CVMFS + EL6 nightly failures still under investigation with upstream
-   Tech team priorities this week: <https://opensciencegrid.atlassian.net/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=19&quickFilter=66>


### Discussion


### Support Update

-   Expanse (Edgar, BrianL): Tracked down some EL8 Bosco incompatibilities. These fixes need to be included in Bosco override fiiles until they're fixed upstream.
-   JLab (Derek): JLab Origin much more stable this week.  Continuing to aggressively monitor, but so far so good.
-   OSG Connect (Derek): StashCP issue when the writeback address is a directory and not a file.  Curl doesn't give an error message, it just gives a non-zero exit code.  So the error from stashcp is cryptic.  Will investigate solution.


## OSG Investigations Team

-   Elasticsearch on Kubernetes!
-   Elasticsearch upgrade upcoming on OSG GRACC coming the end of this month.
