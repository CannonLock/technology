## OSG Software Team

-   Doc focus this Thursday Oct 29 1:30pm
-   Kubernetes hackathon tomorrow Oct 27 12:00pm
-   CVMFS + EL6 nightly failures due to SELinux issue and newly changed OSG CVMFS config; workaround in place
-   Tech team priorities this week: <https://opensciencegrid.atlassian.net/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=19&quickFilter=66>


### Discussion

-   Our VIRGO contact is the VIRGO Computing Coordinator Stefano Bagnasco (bagnasco@to.infn.it).
-   IRIS-HEP Analysis Systems workshop today and tomorrow.
-   AI (Diego): diagnose XRootD 5 on EL8 issues.
-   AI (Edgar):
    -   debug why xrootd-multiuser plugin keeps XRootD server from starting.
    -   debug why binary used to generate macaroons is core dumping; contact Zach Miller for assistance.
-   AI (Mat): help Mark Coatsworth with EL8/Python3 support for HTCondor-CE.

-   Multiple issues with BOSCO/Hosted-CEs:
    -   Job persistence hasn't been implemented for Hosted-CE containers yet, which means restarts kill jobs.
        This makes testing and config updates somewhat harmful.
        A potential solution is using a PersistendVolumeClaim but that's not easy on SLATE.
    -   Bosco keeps persistent state in `/tmp`; Expanse had their submit node set up with DNS round-robin which means state was sometimes there, sometimes not.
        Edgar added a manual workaround.

### Support Update

-   Expanse (Edgar, BrianL): CMS user not being set up properly and PATH being overriden: PRs in to fix both
-   JLab (Edgar): Figured out origin port re-use issue: problem with the site config


## OSG Investigations Team

-   Elasticsearch on Kubernetes!
-   OASIS upgrade last week (supports SSH logins via authorized keys registered in COmanage!).
-   OSG GRACC upgrade coming this week, v7.8.2 -> v7.9.2.
