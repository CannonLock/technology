## OSG Software Team

-   WN client installs and StashCache tests fail in the release due to EPEL gfal requiring XRootD 5  
    -   Workaround: `yum install osg-wn-client --enablerepo=osg-upcoming`
    -   We'll need to build gfal2-plugin-xrootd for OSG 3.5
-   Tech team priorities this week: <https://opensciencegrid.atlassian.net/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=19&quickFilter=66>


### Discussion

AI (TimT): give BrianL HTCondor yum repo URLs to include in the OSG nightly tests


### Support Update

-   CMS (Marian, Derek): Running into issues with XRootD 5 and GSI/VOMS authN; perhaps related to an xrootd-lcmaps config issue that John Thiltges ran into
-   FNAL (Derek): CVMFS sync stopped working and they switched to another one and has been resolved
-   JLab (Carl): still waiting on JLab to sort out DNS and firewall issues before we can verify their CE


## OSG Investigations Team

-   Elasticsearch on Kubernetes!  Need to add logstash
-   XRootD 5 on the LIGO origin (Thanks John)
-   xrootd-scitokens requires some work requested from Andy about renaming things to be consistent with XRootD.
-   OSG GRACC upgrade coming this week, v7.8.2 -> v7.9.2.
