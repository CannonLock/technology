## OSG Software Team

-   WN client installs and StashCache tests fail in the release due to EPEL gfal requiring XRootD 5  
    -   Workaround: `yum install osg-wn-client --enablerepo=osg-upcoming`
    -   We'll need to build gfal2-plugin-xrootd for OSG 3.5
-   Tech team priorities this week: <https://opensciencegrid.atlassian.net/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=19&quickFilter=66>
