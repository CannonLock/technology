## OSG Software Team

-   HTCondor-CE + PBS EPEL testing nightlies job submissions are failing
-   Software base image builds are failing due to "invalid tag" (maybe leading space?):  <https://github.com/opensciencegrid/docker-software-base/runs/1437033352?check_suite_focus=true#step:7:16>


### Discussion

-   AI (TimT): will investigate HTCondor-CE + PBS EPEL testing failures; may require BLAHP fixes
-   AI (Marco): Contact Mats Rynge for TOKEN support for the ITB FE.
-   AI (Carl):
    -   Multi site support for pilot probe
    -   GHA for per-commit builds for gratia-probe
