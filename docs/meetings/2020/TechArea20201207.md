## OSG Software Team

-   EL8 builds appear to automatically add package requirements for shebang lines. Beware `/usr/bin/env python3`!
-   Tech area plates: <https://opensciencegrid.atlassian.net/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=19>


### Discussion

-   Marco: GWMS 3.7.2 released, includes bugfixes for IDTOKEN support; in upcoming-testing.AI (Mat): Submit bug report for XRootD 5.1.0rc1 problem detected in VMU tests.
-   AI (Mat): Mail GridCF list about Travis CI's policy changes.
-   AI (Mat): Ask Marco Mascheroni if he's happy with the new Pilot sections for OSG Configure.
-   AI (Mat): Continue work on OSG flocking negotiator.
-   AI (BrianL): Investigate webapp frameworks and EL 8 compatibility for HTCondor CE View.
-   AI (Junheng): Investigate registry logout error.
-   AI (TimT): Add PowerPC support to EPEL HTCondor packages.
-   VPN access now required to log in to Fermicloud head node (fcluigpvm01.fnal.gov).
    2FA required to access Fermi VPN.
    Steve Timm's suggested solution is to create a (persistent) VM for creating other VMs if that's not possible.  
    Marco will send instructions on how to get access to Fermi VPN.


### Support Update

-   IceCube (Mat, Derek): Stash Origin now appears to work after creating dummy SciTokens information in Topology.  
    UCL stash origin needed the same fix but needs additional debugging; Derek is providing assistance.
-   JLab (BrianL): blahp status queries time out trying to populate the Slurm job status cache.  
    Opened a ticket with the the HTCondor team: <https://opensciencegrid.atlassian.net/browse/HTCONDOR-104>
