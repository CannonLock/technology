-   Marco: Working on adding GitHub Actions and plans to use artifacts instead of caches since the former is longer lived
-   AI (Mat): Ensure GridCF can make a GCT release
-   AI (TimT): Prepare for new CA release.
-   AI (TimT): Automate BOSCO and tarball updates; create tarballs for PPC architecture.Announcements:


### Support Update

-   CMS (Marian): European CMS still mostly on XRootD 4 due to AAA dependency; still discussing migration plans.
-   Miron (Carl): Continue investigating issues with Compute Canada sites erroneously showing up in the CC\* dashboard
-   UCL (Mat): Help UCL test authenticated stash origin. Discuss with Derek and Brian B about what kind of authentication is desired.
