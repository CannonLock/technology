### Discussion

- Doc focus will concentrate on 3.6 documentation; those who can make it should use the whole day
- GlideinWMS 3.9.1 will be released later today


### Support Update

- Carl:
    - Support ticket for batch vs payload core hour discrepancy (needs further investigation and will be tracked in JIRA instead)
    - Helping Daniel Caunt at Harvard with Topology registration
    - Working with Lincoln B to help UIUC work around CE problems caused by deletion of state at boot time

- Derek:
    - Working with Purdue to try and resolve missing Gratia data caused by their SLURM database going down and the CE not creating history entries on job removal; BrianL says the latter may be by design
        - These kinds of issues should stop happening once we move to the HTCondor-CE probe instead of the batch system probes

## OSG DevOps

-   GRACC (continued progress):
    -   migrating more GRACC services to Tiger (Prometheus)

    -   Rolling update is starting this week.
    -   APEL Reporting - still investigating whether should we update to the new AMS
-   Gratia probe update for queue time metric
-   XRootD accounting information (from Frank):
    -   Table of working set, read, and re-read for monthly, quarterly, and year.
    -   Map of StashCache origins and caches.  Discussing implementation details with Tim.
