-   OSG 3.5.32  
    -   AI (Carl): Release XRootD 5.1.0 (<https://opensciencegrid.atlassian.net/browse/SOFTWARE-4356>)


### Discussion

- GlideinWMS 3.7.3 expected next week; will not include cvmfsexec integration but HTCondor version comparison bugs should be fixed.
- New Docker version 20.10.4 caused hung jobs all over CHTC. TimT dealing with the fallout -- others should avoid upgrading.
- Debian build files have been merged into scitokens-cpp; Derek should tag a new release.
- HTCondor 8.9.12 in progress; developers working on updating the default security configuration.
- Many EL8 tickets in Ready for Testing will be moved back to Open to update package versions.

### Support Update

- Mat: Misconfigured CVMFS/Squid at Wisconsin; Mat will register CHTC Squid in Topology; CHTC infrastructure will take care of more involved config changes.
- Derek: Debugging Folding@Home issues at Syracuse; likely requires Folding@Home configuration change to deal with consumer GPUs at Syracuse.
- Derek/Carl: Continuing to debug Purdue accounting discrepancy -- urgent because the WLCG is finalizing monthly accounting info soon.
- Marian: Assisting IGWN users at Georgia Tech with getting jobs running from their submit host. (https://support.opensciencegrid.org/a/tickets/66744)
- Marian: Debugging OASIS issues with jobs running at CRUSH.
