    -   AI (Carl): Release XRootD 5.1.0 (<https://opensciencegrid.atlassian.net/browse/SOFTWARE-4356>)


### Discussion

We only need to build `xrootd-hdfs` build for 3.5 EL7 upcoming, can be ignored for 3.6 and 3.5 EL8 upcoming


### Support Update

-   AGLT2 (BrianL): helped them downgrade to OSG 3.5 after an upgrade to 3.6. In addition to downgrading RPMs, they had to uncomment the line in `/etc/grid-security/gsi-authz.conf` to re-enable LCMAPS
-   Purdue (BrianL): ran into issues with the new supervisord backfill container not having rootly permissions
-   Purdue (Carl, Derek): made custom Gratia probe to generate missed February records


## OSG DevOps

-   OSG Status page: Moving synchronization to Tiger (pull request submitted)
-   XRootD accounting information (from Frank):
    -   May need help with automating the process of generating these reports.  A month only takes a few minutes.  Longer periods take much longer.
    -   Table of working set, read, and re-read for monthly, quarterly, and year.
-   PATh metrics writing is ongoing for user "wait time"


### Discussion
