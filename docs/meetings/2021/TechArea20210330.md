-   OSG 3.5.33/3.6  
    -   `xrootd-multiuser` is broken for XRootD 5. Should we delay the release?
    -   `osg-xrootd` needs to be updated to fix its use of `ofs.authlib`
    -   Anything else we should document in the update notes?
-   AI (Carl, with help from Mat): Enable networking in Koji builds

### Support Update

-   Chameleon Cloud (BrianL): investigating an issue where the OSG validation script is failing so the container isn't running jobs


## OSG DevOps
-   XRootD accounting information (from Frank):  
    -   May need help with automating the process of generating these reports.  A month only takes a few minutes.  Longer periods take much longer.
    -   Table of working set, read, and re-read for monthly, quarterly, and year.
