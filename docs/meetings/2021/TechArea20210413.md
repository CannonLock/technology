None this week  


### Support Update

-   SIUE (BrianL): they're trying out a self-hosted CE in front of their Ubuntu 20 cluster
-   University of Tennessee Chattanooga (BrianL): multi-VO Hosted CEs don't work because HTCondor-CE sets `HOME` from the CE by default.  
    Fixed in to-be-released versions of HTCondor-CE
-   Lancium (Mat): debug low contributions after updating to the latest backfill container image


## OSG DevOps

-   XRootD accounting information (from Frank):  
    -   May need help with automating the process of generating these reports.  A month only takes a few minutes.  Longer periods take much longer.
    -   Table of working set, read, and re-read for monthly, quarterly, and year.


### Discussion

None this week  


## OSG Release Team

-   Need to send ready for testing email today
-   Aiming to release XRootD 5 this week, at least in 3.5 upcoming
