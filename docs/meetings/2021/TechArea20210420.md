### Support Update

    note that the switch from batch system probes to the HTCondor-CE probe in OSG 3.6 should prevent issues like this in the future.

## OSG DevOps

-   XRootD accounting information (from Frank):  
    -   May need help with automating the process of generating these reports.  A month only takes a few minutes.  Longer periods take much longer.
