-   hosted-ce35 not reporting in - Carl to investigate since it's running the Python 3 version of the Gratia probe.


### Support Update

BrianL, Mat - Lancium was seeing multiple issues for backfill containers; one of the issues was having newlines in the token, which caused HTCondor to report failure to parse.
  Will ask developers how HTCondor parses tokens.

### Discussion

HTCondor 9.0.0 bug: AES encryption + x509 proxy refresh crashes the starter.
Brian L will discuss it with developers to see if it affects the OSG infrastructure.
This may be fixed in 9.0.1 (expected next week);
if not, we will mention it as a known issue in the release notes.
