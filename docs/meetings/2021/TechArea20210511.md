## OSG Software Team

-   GSI Transition  
    -   AI (Carl): will Gratia ignore SciTokens-based pilots?
    -   AI (Carl): HTCondor-CE Gratia probe should avoid use of `condor_ce_q`
-   XRootD in 3.6  
    -   Need to document native VOMS and SciTokens auth. Upstream docs? [SciTokens](https://github.com/xrootd/xrootd/tree/master/src/XrdSciTokens)
    -   osg-xrootd needs to be updated (at least removing LCMAPS + config)
    -   Topology changes probably need to be made to also support the new format
-   Any new sites/CEs should be directed to the "Campus Facilitation" FD group


### Discussion

None this week  


### Support Update

None this week  

-   (Derek) ORNL is running a patched slurm gratia probe.  We should engage with them to run a production probe, if we can.  But their use case complicates things.


## OSG DevOps

-   GRACC ITB Collector k8s on Tiger [Jira](https://opensciencegrid.atlassian.net/browse/OPS-184)
-   XRootD Multiuser: One more comment from Andy, so there will be a 1.0.1 (sorry)
    -   Known not to work with xrootd async io.  But that might be ok.
-   StashCP go client is working, just waiting on effort from Derek on how to package / deliver it.  As a reminder, compiling on EL7 makes it work on EL7, 8, ubuntu...  Go is great!
-   XRootD accounting information (from Frank):
    -   May need help with automating the process of generating these reports.  A month only takes a few minutes.  Longer periods take much longer.
    -   Table of working set, read, and re-read for monthly, quarterly, and year.


### Discussion

None this week

### Discussion

HTCondor 9.0.0 bug: AES encryption + x509 proxy refresh crashes the starter.  
Brian L will discuss it with developers to see if it affects the OSG infrastructure.  
This may be fixed in 9.0.1 (expected next week);  
if not, we will mention it as a known issue in the release notes.
