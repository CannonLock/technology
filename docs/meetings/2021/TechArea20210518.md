## OSG Software Team

-   Kubernetes Hackathon this afternoon: <https://opensciencegrid.atlassian.net/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=34&sprint=32>

    -   AI (Mat): osg-xrootd and documentation need to be updated to use the voms-xrootd-plugin for 3.6
    -   AI (Mat): XRootD for EL8
    -   AI (Carl): Gratia probe Hosted CE quarantine issues
    -   AI (Carl): Gratia probe collection of VO data for token-based pilots
    -   Do we need to update the Gratia dirs for OSG 3.6? <https://opensciencegrid.atlassian.net/browse/SOFTWARE-4621>


### Discussion

None this week  


### Support Update

-   Hosted CEs (BrianL): cert-manager changes (?) resulted in a slightly different LE chain being advertised from the CEs, requiring an update to `osg-ca-certs-1.96` on the client side
-   XRootD (Derek): Justas opened tickets with XRootD, watching to see if OSG can contribute to debugging / development for fixes.


## OSG DevOps

-   GRACC ITB Collector k8s on Tiger [Jira](https://opensciencegrid.atlassian.net/browse/OPS-184)
-   GRACC S3 (CEPH) backup coming up, will coordinate a disaster recovery drill.
-   XRootD Multiuser: One more comment from Andy, so there will be a 1.0.1 (sorry)  
    -   Known not to work with xrootd async io.  But that might be ok.
-   StashCP go client is working, just waiting on effort from Derek on how to package / deliver it.  As a reminder, compiling on EL7 makes it work on EL7, 8, ubuntu&#x2026;  Go is great!
-   XRootD accounting information (from Frank):  
    -   May need help with automating the process of generating these reports.  A month only takes a few minutes.  Longer periods take much longer.
    -   Table of working set, read, and re-read for monthly, quarterly, and year.
