## OSG Software Team

-   Release  
    -   AI (Mat): Review scitokens-cpp promotion request (should we release it for EL8?)
    -   AI (Mat): XRootD for EL8 for OSG 3.5
    -   Fix default HTCondor-CE ProbeConfig default dirs (<https://opensciencegrid.atlassian.net/browse/SOFTWARE-4621>)
-   AI (Carl): walk Lehigh/SIUE through recovering their old accounting records


### Discussion

-   We should release scitokens-cpp for EL8 in order to maintain symmetry with EL7
-   GlideinWMS 3.9.2 is in osg-development and has passed internal testing; TimT will promote it to contrib



### Support Update

-   SIUE/Lehigh (Carl, BrianL): identified pilot accounting upload bugs (fixed in `gratia-probe-1.23.3` and the HTCondor versions in testing)
-   PSU (BrianL): `$HOME` expansion doesn't work for Hosted CEs submitting to local HTCondor batch systems
-   CIT/IGWN (Marian): Marian is providing assistance with upgrading to HTCondor 9
-   GlideinWMS (Marco): Found a bug where temporary errors contacting the frontend collectors would get cached, causing further queries to fail until the cache expired or the frontend was restarted.
    This will be fixed in 3.7.5
-   OZStar (Derek): StashCache is not connecting to the ligo origin correctly.  Difficult to iterate since in Australia.  Diego and I setup a time to meet that works for all.
-   KSU / JLab (Derek/Marian): Failures at KSU.  Difficult to tell what exactly the failures are, but the faliure has something to do with xrootd, the posix preload, and downloading a file from jalb.

## OSG DevOps

-   GRACC ITB Collector k8s on Tiger [Jira](https://opensciencegrid.atlassian.net/browse/OPS-184).  Pull request: https://github.com/opensciencegrid/tiger-osg-config/pull/173
-   XRootD Multiuser: 1.1.0 is tagged: https://opensciencegrid.atlassian.net/browse/SOFTWARE-4658
-   StashCP go client is working and tested, just waiting on effort from Derek on how to package / deliver it.  As a reminder, compiling on EL7 makes it work on EL7, 8, ubuntu&#x2026;  Go is great!
-   Bluepring meeting for xrootd-monitoring identified a new service to be written.  The xrootd-shoveler is currently being written up in a design document.

-   (Stalled, but need to get back to it) XRootD accounting information (from Frank):  
    -   May need help with automating the process of generating these reports.  A month only takes a few minutes.  Longer periods take much longer.
    -   Table of working set, read, and re-read for monthly, quarterly, and year.
