## OSG Software Team

-   Release  
    -   AI (Mat): Review scitokens-cpp promotion request (should we release it for EL8?)
    -   AI (Mat): XRootD for EL8 for OSG 3.5
    -   Fix default HTCondor-CE ProbeConfig default dirs (<https://opensciencegrid.atlassian.net/browse/SOFTWARE-4621>)
-   AI (Carl): walk Lehigh/SIUE through recovering their old accounting records


### Discussion

None this week  


### Support Update

-   SIUE/Lehigh (Carl, BrianL): identified pilot accounting upload bugs (fixed in `gratia-probe-1.23.3` and the HTCondor versions in testing)
-   PSU (BrianL): `$HOME` expansion doesn't work for Hosted CEs submitting to local HTCondor batch systems


## OSG DevOps

-   GRACC ITB Collector k8s on Tiger [Jira](https://opensciencegrid.atlassian.net/browse/OPS-184)
-   XRootD Multiuser: One more comment from Andy, so there will be a 1.0.1 (sorry)  
    -   Known not to work with xrootd async io.  But that might be ok.
-   StashCP go client is working, just waiting on effort from Derek on how to package / deliver it.  As a reminder, compiling on EL7 makes it work on EL7, 8, ubuntu&#x2026;  Go is great!
-   XRootD accounting information (from Frank):  
    -   May need help with automating the process of generating these reports.  A month only takes a few minutes.  Longer periods take much longer.
    -   Table of working set, read, and re-read for monthly, quarterly, and year.
