## OSG Software Team

-   Tim makeup doc focus
-   Release  
    -   AI (Mat): XRootD 5.3.0 RC4
    -   AI (Carl): Fix default HTCondor-CE ProbeConfig default dirs (SOFTWARE-4621) (<https://opensciencegrid.atlassian.net/browse/SOFTWARE-4621>)
    -   AI (Carl): Move 99<sub>gratia</sub>-ce.conf to /usr/share location
    -   AI (Carl): Missing zero walltime records
    -   AI (BrianL): Remove deps needed for Globus from HTCondor in 3.6


### Discussion

-   Madison would like GlideinWMS container images with immutable tags for their production frontends.
    Currently the images are contributed by Diego, but BrianL will make a ticket for tracking the issue.

-   GlideinWMS 3.7 series release not expected until a few weeks from now.

-   Upstream HTCondor 9.0.2 and BLAHP 2.1.0 release planned for tomorrow (7/7);
    TimT will provide BrianL with a BLAHP tarball for testing.


### Support Update

-   SUT (BrianL): remote host missing libltdl
-   IGWN frontend (Marian): proxy was not getting renewed, but a pod redeploy fixed the issue.
    Investigate the original cause; BrianL thinks it might have been a Fetch-CRL error.
-   GLOW (Derek): Removed abnormal CMS records (900,000+ hours for 1 job), and re-uploaded WLCG records for June.


## OSG DevOps

-   StashCP go client is working and tested, and being tested by Christina now. Need to talk to Mats on packaging and releasing. (will follow up)
-   Design document is done and is being distributed for xrootd monitoring collector NG (next gen).  Shoveler development has begun!
-   XRootD TCP plugin is ready for packaging.  Derek will follow up with software team on who to hand that off to.
-   Discussions of xrootd-multiuser support for checksumming on-the-fly.  Derek needs to discuss with XRootD team, but it will be on Derek's plate.
-   More partners are asking about scitokens-cpp, and compatibility.  Expect some updates.

-   (Stalled, but need to get back to it) XRootD accounting information (from Frank):  
    -   May need help with automating the process of generating these reports.  A month only takes a few minutes.  Longer periods take much longer.
    -   Table of working set, read, and re-read for monthly, quarterly, and year.
