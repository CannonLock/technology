-   StashCP go client is working and tested, and being tested by Christina now. Need to talk to Mats on packaging and releasing. (will follow up)
-   Design document is done and is being distributed for xrootd monitoring collector NG (next gen).  Shoveler development has begun!
-   XRootD TCP plugin is ready for packaging.  Derek will follow up with software team on who to hand that off to.
-   Discussions of xrootd-multiuser support for checksumming on-the-fly.  Derek needs to discuss with XRootD team, but it will be on Derek's plate.
-   More partners are asking about scitokens-cpp, and compatibility.  Expect some updates.

-   (Stalled, but need to get back to it) XRootD accounting information (from Frank):  
    -   May need help with automating the process of generating these reports.  A month only takes a few minutes.  Longer periods take much longer.
