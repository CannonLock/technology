### Discussion

-   GlideinWMS 3.7.5 still in progress; release candidate expected today/tomorrow;
    rc will contain cvmfsexec support


### Support Update

-   Georgia Tech (BrianL): Gave them some AP HTCondor config that should prevent pilots from flocking out to pilots
-   Lancium (BrianL, Mats): live backfill container debugging session that uncovered issues in the periodic health check
    not properly detecting unpriv Singularity.
-   Multiple (Derek): Several sites had failed gratia probes over the last week.  All isolated events, but I think there were 4 at the same time.

## OSG DevOps

-   Elasticsearch will need to be updated.  Working on a schedule.
-   StashCP go client is working and tested, and being tested by Christina now. Need to talk to Mats on packaging and releasing. (will follow up).  No news from Christina,
-   Design document is done and is being distributed for xrootd monitoring collector NG (next gen).  Shoveler is working and lightly tested.  Collector is 50% done.  Design document is still not reviewed, but moving foward anyways.
-   XRootD TCP plugin is ready for packaging.  Derek will follow up with software team on who to hand that off to.
-   Discussions of xrootd-multiuser support for checksumming on-the-fly.  After a discussion, the checksum-on-the-fly funcationality will be ported to xrootd-multiuser.  Copied largely from xrootd-hdfs.  This does mean that out-of-order writes will not be supported.
-   More partners are asking about scitokens-cpp, and compatibility.  Expect some updates.
    -   Maybe we have been doing tokens wrong?  Use the \`typ\` rather than \`ver\`.


-   (Stalled, but need to get back to it) XRootD accounting information (from Frank):
    -   May need help with automating the process of generating these reports.  A month only takes a few minutes.  Longer periods take much longer.
    -   Table of working set, read, and re-read for monthly, quarterly, and year.
