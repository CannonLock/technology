### Discussion

-   GRACC upgrade is planned for the end of August
-   Diego noticed some condor_mapfile entries weren't matching if the incoming
    cert had both commas and VOMS attributes.  There's a regex recipe that
    fixes it, which needs to be documented (HTCONDOR-651)

### Support Update

-   Brown (BrianL): authN failures with their GridFTP + XRootD setup
-   Caltech (BrianL): investigated 8.8.15 stacktrace
-   LIGO-WA & LIGO-LA (Carl): invstigating missing probes in the
    payload summary page
-   GlideinWMS (Marco):
    -   removed the code section in the user job wrapper that
        tried to add condor_chirp; will be replaced with a
        Python version
    -   3.7 release candidate still in progress


## OSG DevOps

New:
-   Request to inject entire HTCondor job classad into GRACC records.  Will require gratia-probe-condor changes.

Ongoing:
-   Elasticsearch will need to be updated, scheduled for last week in August.
-   StashCP go client is working and tested, and being tested by Christina now. Need to talk to Mats on packaging and releasing. (will follow up).  No news from Christina,
-   Design document is done and is being distributed for xrootd monitoring collector NG (next gen).  Shoveler is working and lightly tested.  Collector is 80% done.  Design document is still not reviewed, but moving foward anyways.
-   Discussions of xrootd-multiuser support for checksumming on-the-fly.  After a discussion, the checksum-on-the-fly funcationality will be ported to xrootd-multiuser.  Copied largely from xrootd-hdfs.  This does mean that out-of-order writes will not be supported.

Back burner:
-   (Stalled, but need to get back to it) XRootD accounting information (from Frank):
    -   May need help with automating the process of generating these reports.  A month only takes a few minutes.  Longer periods take much longer.
    -   Table of working set, read, and re-read for monthly, quarterly, and year.
-   XRootD TCP plugin is ready for packaging.  Derek will follow up with software team on who to hand that off to.
