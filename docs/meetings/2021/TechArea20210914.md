### Support Update

-   Florida (BrianL): uncovered a few bugs with job router transforms in HTCondor-CE 5.1.1.
    To be fixed in 5.1.2 in an expected upstream release this week.

## OSG DevOps

New:
-   GRACC update completed; backup service verification to come this week.
-   Request to inject entire HTCondor job classad into GRACC records.  Will require gratia-probe-condor changes.
-   Stashcp changes to support authenticated reading from /ospool namespace.

Ongoing:
-   Shoveler is working and lightly tested.  Collector is 90% done.
-   Checksums in xrootd-multiuser is 80% done.

Back burner:
-   (Stalled, but need to get back to it) XRootD accounting information (from Frank):
    -   May need help with automating the process of generating these reports.  A month only takes a few minutes.  Longer periods take much longer.
    -   Table of working set, read, and re-read for monthly, quarterly, and year.
-   XRootD TCP plugin is ready for packaging.  Derek will follow up with software team on who to hand that off to.
