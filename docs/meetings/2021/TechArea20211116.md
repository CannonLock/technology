### Discussion

None this week

### Support Update

-   Georgia State University (BrianL): needed to add pre-populated `known_hosts` since `ssh-keyscan` doesn't work with
    jump hosts
-   JLab (BrianL): had a meeting to discuss token issuers; they'll likely start with a local issuer for pilots and will
    consider CILogon as their issuer
-   Nikhef (BrianL, Marian, Diego): helped troubleshoot IDTOKEN exchange since they updated to OSG 3.6

## OSG DevOps

New:
-   Transition to IDTOKENs for IGWN, JLab, GLUEX
-   Shoveler and Collector is tested, and UNL is using it in production now.
    - Now writing docs on how to run the shoveler.

Ongoing:
-   Request to inject entire HTCondor job classad into GRACC records. Will require gratia-probe-condor changes.  

Back burner:
-   (Stalled, but need to get back to it) XRootD accounting information (from Frank):
    -   May need help with automating the process of generating these reports.  A month only takes a few minutes.  Longer periods take much longer.
    -   Table of working set, read, and re-read for monthly, quarterly, and year.
-   XRootD TCP plugin is ready for packaging.  Derek will follow up with software team on who to hand that off to.
