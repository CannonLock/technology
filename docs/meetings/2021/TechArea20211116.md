### Support Update

-   Georgia State University (BrianL): needed to add pre-populated `known_hosts` since `ssh-keyscan` doesn't work with
    jump hosts
-   JLab (BrianL): had a meeting to discuss token issuers; they'll likely start with a local issuer for pilots and will
    consider CILogon as their issuer
-   Nikhef (BrianL, Marian, Diego): helped troubleshoot IDTOKEN exchange since they updated to OSG 3.6
