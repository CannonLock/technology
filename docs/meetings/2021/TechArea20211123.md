    -   AI (BrianL): Investigate OSPool registry pod stuck in `Pending`
    -   AI (BrianL): Give CMS a recipe to generate pilot configuration without using `osg-configure`

### Discussion

HTCondor `scitokens-credmon` for EL8: aiming for Post-christmas release

Marco: Fixing GlideinWMS 3.7.6 bugs; afterwards, further development will be Python 3 only.
There are several patches used in OSG OS Pool frontend -- Marco will talk to Mats Rynge about getting them upstream.

Proxy delegation in the OSG 3.6 build of HTCondor 9 is broken; does not affect the OSG 3.5-upcoming build, and will be fixed in 9.0.8.

Fermilab is hiring for a developer position.

### Support Update

-   Lancium (BrianL): GPUs not showing up in Lancium resources due to HTCondor 9.0.6 GPU discovery bug;
    OS Registry doesn't work with Google IDs since they don't provide an `eduPersonPrincipalName` (`eppn`)
-   Nikhef (BrianL, Marian, Diego): helped troubleshoot IDTOKEN exchange since they updated to OSG 3.6
-   LBL (Mat): Gratia probes weren't reporting in; this was due to files on disk not having been properly restored from backup;
    `yum reinstall` fixed the issue.
