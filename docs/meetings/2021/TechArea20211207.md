## OSG Software Team

-   AI (Mat): Create secondary instance of repo.openscience.org on the UChicago River cluster.
-   AI (Mat): Test vault/htvault-config/htgettoken
-   AI (Brian): Set osg-flock VOOverride to "osg"
-   AI (TimT): Release HTCondors 9.0.8 and 9.4.0


### Discussion

-   Tim added "devops-minefield" repos to osg-release; this can be tested manually.
-   Marco:
    -   GlideinWMS 3.7.6 is in progress; most GitHub issues have been merged, as well as a new check for expired tokens.
        A release candidate is expected later today.

    -   The GlideinWMS license is changing from Fermi-modified BSD to Apache2;
        using REUSE (reuse.software) and SPDX (spdx.org), which make managing licenses in source code very convenient;
        these might be also be useful for other OSG projects and HTCondor team.

### Support Update

-   BNL (Mat): debug authentication issues when accessing an xrootd server using WebDAV
-   Lancium (Mat, BrianL): debug not finding Singularity in backfill container
-   GATech (Derek): Gratia probe is reporting a lot of groups.

## OSG DevOps

- Stashcp now supports recursive downloads.  Release upcoming.  How should we handle packaging of stashcache-client in OSG repos?
    - Some stashcp debugging is in order for proxy support.
- xrootd-monitoring-shoveler running at UCSD and Florida (RPM) and UNL (K8s)
- Go packaging:
    - No network for builds, so deps come from EPEL or from a dependency bundle.
    - Derek will investigate what dependencies are already in EPEL (likely all of them)

### Discussion

None this week
