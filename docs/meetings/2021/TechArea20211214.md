### Support Update

-   BNL (Mat): debug authentication issues when accessing an xrootd server using WebDAV
-   Lancium (BrianL): moved them over to Singularity-in-Singularity and had to adjust their bind mount settings
-   GATech (Derek): Gratia probe is reporting a lot of groups.

## OSG DevOps

- Stashcp now supports recursive downloads.  Release upcoming.  How should we handle packaging of stashcache-client in OSG repos?
    - Some stashcp debugging is in order for proxy support.
- xrootd-monitoring-shoveler running at UCSD and Florida (RPM) and UNL (K8s)
- Go packaging:
    - No network for builds, so deps come from EPEL or from a dependency bundle.
    - Derek will investigate what dependencies are already in EPEL (likely all of them)
