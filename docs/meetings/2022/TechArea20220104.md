## OSG Software Team

- Mat: update stashcache-client RPM to contain stashcp 6.4.0
- TimT: release HTCondor 9.0.9+, HTCondor 9.5.0+

### Discussion

-   HTCondor developers adding Rocky Linux 8 as one of their platforms for UW
    builds (replacing CentOS Linux 8, which was EOL as of the end of last
    year).  OSG is testing on Rocky Linux 8 (among other compatible platforms)
    but still using CentOS Linux 8 for build repos; no decision on yet on which
    variant to use as a replacement but CentOS Stream 8 is likely since that is
    what Fermilab is using.

### Support Update

-   Doug Benjamin (BNL) needed to be added as a Topology contact for several
    resources for submitting downtime; TimC is working on making sure Topology
    contacts are up to date.

-   Gluex was unable to access some of their files hosted on stash origins via
    CVMFS; their directory had too many files and bloated the CVMFS catalog to the
    point where it kept getting evicted from clients' caches.  Derek split the catalog
    into smaller catalogs, which should solve the problem.
