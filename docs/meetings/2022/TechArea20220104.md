### Support Update

## OSG DevOps

- Stashcp now supports recursive downloads.  Release upcoming.  How should we handle packaging of stashcache-client in OSG repos?
    - Some stashcp debugging is in order for proxy support.
- xrootd-monitoring-shoveler running at UCSD and Florida (RPM) and UNL (K8s)
- Go packaging:
    - No network for builds, so deps come from EPEL or from a dependency bundle.
    - Derek will investigate what dependencies are already in EPEL (likely all of them)
