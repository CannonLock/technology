## OSG Software Team

-   Kubernetes Hackathon today! Potential projects:
    -   Add Prometheus monitoring for the Postgresql node
    -   Set up a secondary CHTC (GLOW) frontend on River
-   AI (Mat): Update osg-configure-bosco dependency and build osg-configure
-   AI (Mat): xcache-reporter packaging issues
-   AI (Mat): kick off tests for GlideinWMS 3.7.6 and 3.9.4
-   AI (BrianL): build new osg-scitokens-mapfile
-   AI (BrianL): add support for manual client registration to osg-token-renewer
-   AI (BrianL): address issues with gratia-probe-condor-ap

### Discussion

-   Additional develoment work is needed to support multi-VO APs, especially with Gratia reporting
    (probes can only deal with one VO at a time) and figuring out how to map jobs to VOs in a way
    that the probe can recognize.

-   `rpm --verify` test in VMU tests does not handle virtual dependencies; it does two things:
    -   verify that all listed packages were installed (can be done with a yum flag)
    -   verify that files on disk match files in package (has caught at least one error within living memory)



### Support Update

- GSU (BrianL): investigate SSH certificate issues
- JLab (BrianL): troubleshoot missing payload records from APs
- Lancium (BrianL): investigate `HAS_SINGULARITY = False`
- SDSC (Mat): troubleshoot cache/origin authentication
