## OSG Software Team

-   Doc focus Friday 1-5pm! Full court press on documentation
-   Consolidating container images to https://github.com/opensciencegrid/images/ (SOFTWARE-4944)
-   AI (Mat): build osg-configure
-   AI (Mat): xcache-reporter packaging issues
-   AI (Mat): apply voms mapfile patch to OSG's build of XRootD; Justas at Caltech can test
-   AI (BrianL): kick off tests for Vault, htgetttoken
-   AI (BrianL): address issues with gratia-probe-condor-ap
-   AI (TimT): prepare HTCondor 9.7.0 release candidate in time for Patch Tuesday

### Discussion

-   osg-token-renewer release is waiting for Dave Dykstra and CILogon developers to diagnose issues
    between OIDC-Agent and CILogon interactions

=   We have updated our container retention policy: timestamped containers will be deleted after 6 months
    or if there are any security issues

### Support Update

- BNL (BrianL): issue was caused by missing/outdated CRLs; Brian will review the support ticket and create any
    necessary JIRA tickets for development work
- GSU (BrianL): investigate SSH certificate issues; turned out to be an expired cert and a bad target post-jump host
- Lancium (BrianL): discussed OSG ownership of container deployment; facilitated an introduction with Igor
- SDSC (Mat): the XrdVoms plugin (used in OSG 3.6) is mapping certificates to a different XRootD identity
    than LCMAPS was.  Mat will investigate if XRootD config changes can solve the issue

- GlideinWMS (Marco): fixing bug related to cloud submission
