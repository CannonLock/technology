## OSG DevOps

- StashCP multi-file download/upload.
- Secured an "Open Source" license for [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/) which is the Professional level.  It's a competitor to Github Codespaces.  Remote development.  My first thought is that it would be nice for topology development since it's difficult (in my experience) to iterate.  Especially initial setup.  License is open to all members of the opensciencegrid github organization.
- Packaging of the shoveler?
- Packaging of the python-scitokens?
- Working on OSDF metrics for OSG Meeting.
