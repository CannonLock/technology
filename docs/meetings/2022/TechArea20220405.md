## OSG Software Team

-   Kubernetes hackathon today:
    -   Dex for Tiger
    -   Update CHTC cache/origin
    -   Upgrade production GLOW frontend
-   AI (Mat): increase default key size in renew proxy (SOFTWARE-5112)
-   AI (Mat): document xcache (and xrootd?) upgrade to 3.6 (SOFTWARE-5109)
-   AI (BrianL): python3-rrdtool for EL7 (SOFTWARE-5080)
-   AI (BrianL): update VOMS clients default proxy key bit length to 2048 bits (SOFTWARE-4889)

### Discussion

-   Marco: adding small requested changes to 3.7.7; 3.9.5 in progress, including the code
    to generate scitokens and wlcg tokens using an external script

-   BrianB ran into an issue with an expired GLOW proxy causing a failure at the factory,
    even though token auth was enabled; he will send Marco the configuration that caused it

-   CMS is still sending 1024-bit proxies which no longer work on EL 8.
    We need to find out where their proxies are generated and ask them to upgrade.
    EL 8 can be configured to accept 1024-bit proxies again, but this makes sites less
    secure so we do not want to recommend it

-   New security release of Go upcoming; no details on the issue yet, but we may
    need to rebuild our software if it's affected

-   CMS has requested that we build worker node images using Alma Linux, because
    they have not validated CentOS Stream 8.  (WLCG sites in general have been avoiding
    Stream 8 because it goes EOL in the middle of Run 3.)  OS SW does not currently test
    Alma but that would not be too difficult to add

### Support Update

-   OSG Connect (BrianL): help with AP update to OSG 3.6
-   UNL (Derek): Correct whole node GRACC accounting

-   UNL (Derek): help with GRACC records issues.  Since UNL is running OSG 3.5 for now,
    they can use the condor batch system probe

-   CRIC (Mat): with BrianB's help found a Topology issue that was causing SSL errors
    for CRIC, caused by CentOS Stream 8 dropping a needed package from their default
    container image

## OSG DevOps
