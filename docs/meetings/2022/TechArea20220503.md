## OSG Software Team

-   Kubernetes Hackathon today!
    -   AI (Carl): Make CronJob for fixing up user GIDs in COManage.
    -   AI (Mat): Investigate auto-update failures in the PATh facility Kubernetes pool.
    -   AI (BrianL): Move FE cert-manager patches to base
    -   AI (BrianL): Investigate upgrade path from Flux v1 to Flux v2
-   Doc focus this Friday
-   Primary MkDocs repositories being moved to the osg-htc GitHub organization.
    Technology first, then docs
-   AI (BrianL): Work with JeffD to debug site failures starting after OSG 3.6 upgrades.
-   AI (BrianL): Respond to Scott Koranda regarding missing EPPNs in COManage.
-   AI (Carl): Remove certinfo usage from Gratia.
-   AI (Mat): Renew central collector host cert (which expires on May 6); UNL SANs are no longer necessary.
-   AI (Mat): Register PATh Facility Execute Points in Topology.
-   AI (TimT): Test HTCondor 9.9.0 in CHTC; new remote management features might impact glideins so those will need extra testing.
-   Next projects:
    -   Transition contacts to COManage
    -   Finish sending OSPool StartD logs to the GRACC
    -   Streamline deployments of OSDF caches and origins
    -   Retire OSG 3.5
    -   Allow for custom workflows in opensciencegrid/images

### Discussion

Added a "contrib" directory to the opensciencegrid/images repo so people can contribute images;
the first contributor was FNAL with some FTS images.
There is a danger of the GitHub Actions for the repo taking too long; the Software Team will investigate fixes as necessary.

### Support Update

-   Derek: Debugging various randomly occurring XRootD-Standalone issues.
-   Derek: Debugging CEs that have stopped reporting to GRACC after upgrading to OSG 3.6;
    will stay in touch with the Software Team regarding necessary software/packaging/documentation fixes resulting from these.
-   Carl: Debug Igor's issue with viewing Topology resources using his COManage credentials.
