## OSG Software Team

-   OSG 3.6
    -   AI (Carl) remove certinfo log messages
    -   AI (Mat) XRootD 5.4.3 RC1
-   Next week:
    -   AI (Mat) Streamlining OSDF service deployment: add Topology endpoint returning a list of OSDF caches for a given
        path
    -   AI (Carl) Topology COManage transition: pull contact db into COManage contact results where missing

### Discussion

-   GlideinWMS stakeholders meeting tomorrow; 3.9.3 release planned.

### Support Update

-   ComputeCanada (BrianL): troubleshoot missing `OSG_WN_TMP` due to HTCondor change from `GLITE_LOCATION` to
    `BLAHPD_LOCATION` in HTCondor 9.3.0

-   Carl: Continue to assist Igor with authentication issues.
    Mats can give him a manually generated token to keep things moving along.
    
-   ODU (Mat): Investigate failure to launch Singularity from CVMFS.

-   UTC-EPYC (Mat): Investigate random job failures; request assistance from HTCondor developers.

-   JLab (Mat): Setting up a cache and an origin; they are planning on having both on one host (in containers) and using the same cert.
    This will cause accounting issues (the StashCache graphs are keyed by hostname)
    but the other central XRootD services should handle it properly.

## OSG DevOps

- A few feature requests / bug fixes for StashCP.  One of them ready for pull request: https://github.com/opensciencegrid/stashcp/pull/41
- Shoveler auto-update is working great!  Increased token lifetime on lightweight issuer to 1 hour.
- Did a large pull request for GP-ARGO.  Wondering if we should include the Site Name in the OSG map?  Currently, we show Facility Name, Resource Group, and Resource names.  But we don't show the site level in the map.
