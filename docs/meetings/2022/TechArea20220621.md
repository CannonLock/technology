## OSG Software Team

-   Streamline deployments of OSDF caches and origins
    -   AI (Mat): Add topology endpoint serving cache/namespace mappings (SOFTWARE-5179)
    -   AI (Mat): Evaluate state of SLATE stashcache chart (SOFTWARE-5211)
    -   AI (Carl): Add stashcache lookup by resource name (SOFTWARE-4347)
    -   AI (Carl): stash-cache/origin: allow toggling VOMS by environment variable (SOFTWARE-5106)
    -   AI (Carl): authfile generation fails if origin serves no public data (SOFTWARE-5028)
    -   AI (Carl): Authfiles for auth stash origins should include the origin's DN (SOFTWARE-4399)
    -   AI (Carl): Validate OSDF data in Topology (SOFTWARE-4167)
-   AI (Carl): add ability to specify custom workflows in opensciencegrid/images (SOFTWARE-5013)

### Discussion

Sketched out a plan to split the Topology git repo into two, one for code and one for data

### Support Update

-   CHTC (Derek, Mat): issues with authenticated access to origin-auth2001
-   OSPool (BrianL, Mat): many shadow failures due to an issue with the user job wrapper.
    Currently suspecting a startd cron script locking issue.
-   JLab (BrianL): JLab and their ScotsGrid site are seeing low CPU utiliziation from Slurm for CLAS12 pilots.
    Seems like we're requesting 8 core pilots but only advertising single core slots.
-   Hosted CEs (Carl): identified an FD file leak in the scitokens-cpp library
