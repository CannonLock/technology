### Discussion

Sometimes packages get stuck in Ready for Testing state because they are considered "critical" but no external people have provided feedback.
Mat suggests amending our release policy such that critical packages are released after a month without negative feedback, even if no positive feedback has been received.
Tim says that would be better for software that has received VMU testing or has been well tested outside of OSG.
We have an IRIS-HEP metric to increase the percentage of packages tested in VMU; Brian will create tickets.
Also discussed improving coordination of testing between OSG Operations and Software
