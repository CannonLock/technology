### Discussion

-   CMS running into problems with their XRootD redirector where due to a misconfiguration, writes went to random hosts.
    They would like a config knob to prevent this kind of misconfiguration; BrianL suggested that they send mail to the
    XRootD development list.

-   IceCube (BrianL): investigate OS Registry failure to issue token due to split of OSPool CCB/CM
-   FNAL (BrianL): diagnose FD leaks affecting Bridges2/Expanse Hosted CEs
-   FNAL (Carl): waiting for response regarding testing of new version of gratia-probes
