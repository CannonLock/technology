## OSG Software Team

-  Kubernetes Hackathon today
-  AI (Mat): build stash-origin chart (SOFTWARE-5258)
-  AI (BrianL): Check on /tmp in HPC exec nodes; update Canary2 to testing
-  AI (Carl): complete custom workflows ticket

### Discussion

-   Mat: Topology DataFederation namespaces PR ready for review and also deployed on ITB.
-   Marco: Working on GlideinWMS 3.9.6; adding Python 3.9 support.
-   Derek: systemd-tmpfiles-setup did not create /var/lock/condor on one site because the "condor" user doesn't exist at
    the time systemd-tmpfiles-setup runs.  TimT says that condor_master since 8.9.12 should create the necessary
    directories on startup if they are missing; he and Derek will debug.

### Support Update

-   Purdue (Derek, Carl, BrianL): help sort out fixes for incorrect accounting of whole node pilots
-   FNAL (BrianL): redeployed FNAL CEs; still on OSG 3.5 so they're at risk of running into the same FD limit again
-   FNAL (Carl): packaging fixes verified by Yujun.
    Submitted PR with some of Yujun's requested changes.
-   BNL (Mat): Still debugging CA certs.  BrianB had a back-and-forth with the admin; Mat will follow along.
-   CLAS12 (Derek): Helping fix gratia, `/var/lock/condor` failed to be created.
-   Florida (Derek): OSG shoveler issuer is issuing token with wrong audience, not sure what's going on, debugging.  (Ugh, the issuer is complicated)

## OSG Release Team

-   Ready for Testing
    -   xrootd-monitoring-shoveler 1.1.2
    -   Upcoming: HTCondor 9.11.0 RC2 (for patch Tuesday)
    -   HTCondor 9.0.16 RC1 (important bug fixes)

### Discussion

No release this week
