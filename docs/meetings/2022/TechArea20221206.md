### Support Update

-   NERSC (Mat, BrianL, BrianB): spoke with XRootD devs about the missing VOMS thread and he suggested compiling with
    print statements
-   UConn (Derek, DaveD): Debug OSDF cache selection.  Was always using KC cache rather than NYC. With Dave's help, 
    debugged it to a bad entry in the geoip DB. Richard sent an update to the upstream DB, which was accepted.
