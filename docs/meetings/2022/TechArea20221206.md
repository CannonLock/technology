## OSG Software Team

-   AI (Carl): EL9 support next items
    -   Create 'buildsys-*' packages (SOFTWARE-5391, SOFTWARE-5392)
    -   Build 'fetch-sources' (SOFTWARE-5393)
-   AI (BrianL): NVidia GPU software-base image (SOFTWARE-5368)

### Discussion

-   Time limit on GHA jobs; may want to consider paid tier for github;
    cross that bridge when we get there.

-   Marco: what's the story with condor el9 support?
    -  10.2.0 will have el9 support
    -  10.0 LTS will not get el9 support (for reasons relating to cgroups support)
    -  el7 EOL in May will trigger updates
    -  until people scream we are not going to add el9 support to 10.0

### Support Update

-   NERSC (Mat, BrianL, BrianB): spoke with XRootD devs about the missing VOMS thread and he suggested compiling with
    print statements.
    Atlas is very interested.

-   Carl: new issues:
    -  fd-71210: OSG 3.6 and OSG connection to Wayne State compute resources
    -  fd-71208: HTCondor-CE Hold jobs randomly (1/day) - Spooling input data

## OSG Release Team

-   Ready for Testing
    -   GlideinWMS 3.9.6
    -   CVMFS 2.10.0-1.1 (and osg-oasis 19)
    -   XRootD 5.5.1-1.4 (fixes FUSE mounts via xrdfs)
    -   Vault 1.12.1
-   Ready for Release
    -   Nothing yet

### Discussion

-   condor 10.0.0 / with upgrading from 9->10;
    -   with gotchas:
        -  mapfile pcre2 character classes
        -  trust domain used to be derived from condor host;
           if trust domain changes need to re-issue tokens.
           THIS MAY BREAK SITES.
           Sites may not want to re-issue tokens;
           may want to go back to trust domain based on condor host.
        -  Used to specify gpus with requirements section;
           now there's a request-gpu keyword:
           people will have to change how they're doing this.
