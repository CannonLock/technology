### Discussion

-   condor 10.0.0 / with upgrading from 9->10;
    -   with gotchas:
        -  mapfile pcre2 character classes
        -  trust domain used to be derived from condor host;
           if trust domain changes need to re-issue tokens.
           THIS MAY BREAK SITES.
           Sites may not want to re-issue tokens;
           may want to go back to trust domain based on condor host.
        -  Used to specify gpus with requirements section;
           now there's a request-gpu keyword:
          end  users will have to change how they're doing this.
