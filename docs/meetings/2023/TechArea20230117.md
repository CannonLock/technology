### Support Update

-   BNL (Brian): Provided XRootD builds with extra debug logging
-   MWT2 (Brian): CE was backed up with high `RecentDaemonCoreDutyCycle` and was backed up handling reads.
    Forks were taking 0.1s so we turned down `SCHEDD_QUERY_WORKERS` down to 2 and it eventually caught back up.
-   Purdue (Brian): helped Colby troubleshoot issues with cred transfer to the EP
