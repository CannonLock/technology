## OSG Software Team

-   Reminder: [triage duty responsibilities](../../policy/software-support.md#triage-duty).
    New duties include Topology data and COManage site contact reviews.
-   AI (Carl): add option to filter OSPool project user map by login group
-   AI (Carl): Kick off appropriate package set tests for EL9
-   AI (Mat): Continue work on container universe changes for the OSPool
-   AI (Mat): XRootD mapfile work
-   AI (Mat): Lancium provisioner backfill container changes

### Discussion

-   GlideinWMS 3.10.1 is in use in the ITB at CERN; this should be sufficient testing to add it to the OSG release.

-   Question about how an HTCondor client validates the server when using IDTOKENS;
    Mat says the client doesn't have a copy of the IDTOKEN signing key so it can't use that method and it must use something else like FS or SSL.

-   Reminder: HTCondor will be built for EL9 only in 3.6-upcoming because the LTS series 10.0 does not support EL9.

### Support Update

-   BNL (Brian): further discussion of weighted slots and GRACC/WLCG accounting
