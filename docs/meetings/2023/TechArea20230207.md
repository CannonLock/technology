## OSG Software Team

-   Reminder: [triage duty responsibilities](../../policy/software-support.md#triage-duty).
    New duties include Topology data and COManage site contact reviews.
-   AI (Carl): Kick off appropriate package set tests for EL9
-   AI (Carl): osg-build branch protection
-   AI (Carl): document more Git opinions
-   AI (Mat): Continue work on container universe changes for the OSPool
-   AI (Mat): XRootD mapfile + Topology work
-   Florida requests a backported fix for <https://github.com/xrootd/xrootd/issues/1874>.
    We've got a lot of patches, should we cut a new build with reduced patches?

    Relatedly, XRootD 5.5.2 has been released; the software team should patch that version instead of 5.5.1.
-   x509-scitokens-issuer, which is in osg-contrib, needs to be rebuilt to sign it with the current OSG 3.6 GPG key.


Kubernetes Hackathon:
-   BrianL: PATh Facility Origin
-   Mat: ITB EP with a GPU for testing container universe changes

### Discussion

-   XRootD developers have requested that the OSG SW team clearly indicate in XRootD packages that they are the
    OSG versions and not upstream; there is a text file in the XRootD packages that can be used for that purpose.

### Support Update

-   BNL (Brian): will hold off on weighted slots work until this sorted out at the WLCG level

## OSG Release Team

-   Ready for Testing
    -   htvault-config 1.14
        -   Add auditlog option to move the audit log to a different location
-   Ready for Release
