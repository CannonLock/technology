## OSG Software Team

-   AI (Carl): Status on EL9 builds? Can we kick off HTCondor-related tests?
-   AI (Mat): review Carl's git branch protection PR
-   AI (Carl): document the Topology webhook
-   AI (Mat): XRootD mapfile + Topology status?
-   x509-scitokens-issuer, which is in osg-contrib, needs to be rebuilt to sign it with the current OSG 3.6 GPG key.
    Did we do this?
-   How to support supplementary groups in xrootd-multiuser? Somehow read works (dir isn't world-readable)
