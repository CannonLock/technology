    -   The tarball to use for CVMFSEXEC will be configurable
    -   Fixes error in configuring token lifetime

-   Horst at OU has successfully installed an EL9 CE; he has reported some documentation issues, which BrianL will review

### Support Update

-   BrianL (Caltech): Gratia probe failures were due to incorrect directory permissions at the site.
    This is not the first time such an error has occurred; the Gratia probe should detect this issue and log and/or refuse to start
    (instead of just discarding records).  BrianL will discuss it with Derek.
-   BrianL: A site in India stopped receiving pilots from Fermilab;
    they reinstalled their CE and need assistance with registration and using token-based pilots
