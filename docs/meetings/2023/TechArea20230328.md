## OSG Software Team

-   Marco: Testing release candidate;
    The last remaining PR before a release is to allow configuring location of CVMFSEXEC tarball

-   It is no longer possible to use an EL 7 machine for development because because the git pre-commit hooks do not work on Python 3.6;
    however, GlideinWMS will continue to _run_ on EL 7.
