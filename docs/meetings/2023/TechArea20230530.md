## OSG Software Team

-   OSG 3.7 planning meeting this morning
-   Kubernetes hackathon this afternoon!
    -   AI (MatS): Create OSDF origin for NIH public data
    -   AI (MatS): Migrate "osg" namespace to Flux V2
-   AI (MattW): Work with TimT to build RPMs for the new IGTF CA cert bundle

### Discussion

-   UFlorida Research Computing policy no longer allows them to install software out of osg-testing,
    so they won't be able to provide community testing for XRootD for us anymore;
    BrianL will ask OU if they would be available for this in the future

### Support Update

-   IGWN (TimT): IGWN is setting up an HTCondor AP; TimT will contact Stefano for a status update
