Approving registrations
-----------------------

1.  Check for an email from <registry@cilogon.org> saying "Petition for <NAME> changed status from
    Confirmed to Pending Approval".

1.  Click the first link in the email.

1.  Log in with your institutional credentials.
    You should see a "View CO Petition..." page.
    The Status should be "Pending Approval".

1.  Verify that the application is legitimate.

1.  Click "Approve".
    You should see "Petition Approved" and "Petition Finalized" on top.
    The Status should now be "Finalized".

1.  The user will get an email saying "Petition for <NAME> changed status from Pending Approval to
    Approved".

    The first link will give them "Permission Denied";
    the second link will take them to the notification page, which they can "acknowledge",
    but that doesn't do anything useful.
