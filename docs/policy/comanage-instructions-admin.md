Approving COManage Registrations
================================

OSG is using a new identity management system called COManage.
This system will be used for managing access to OSG staff-internal monitoring webpages at UNL
and managing access for OASIS logins.

User registrations must be manually approved by a COManage admin.
Follow the instructions below to approve a user registration.

!!! note
    This page is for COManage Admins who want to approve user registrations.
    If you are a user who wants to register with COManage,
    go to the [Registering for the OSG COManage](/policy/comanage-instructions-user) page instead.


1.  Check for an email from <registry@cilogon.org> saying "Petition for <NAME> changed status from
    Confirmed to Pending Approval".

1.  Click the first link in the email.

1.  Log in with your institutional credentials.
    You should see a "View CO Petition..." page.
    The Status should be "Pending Approval".

1.  Verify that the application is legitimate.

1.  Click "Approve".
    You should see "Petition Approved" and "Petition Finalized" on top.
    The Status should now be "Finalized".

1.  The user will get an email saying "Petition for <NAME> changed status from Pending Approval to
    Approved".

    The links in the email are expected to be useless
    (the first link will give them "Permission Denied" and
    the second link will merely allow them to "acknowledge" that they received the email).

    If the user asks, reassure them that they are registered and no further action needs to be taken.
