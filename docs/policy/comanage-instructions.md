COManage Registration Instructions
==================================

This page provides step-by-step instructions for registering with COManage and becoming a part of
the OSG group.
There are separate instructions for registering and approving registrations.

Our initial users will be OSG staff, but as the system becomes more fleshed out, OASIS managers
and site admins will also be getting registered.


Registering for the OSG COManage
--------------------------------

1.  Go to https://registry.cilogon.org/registry/co_petitions/start/coef:64

1.  Search for your institution and select it.

1.  Log in with your institutional credentials.
    You should reach the "OSG Registration: Self Signup With Approval" page.

1.  Click "BEGIN".

1.  Enter your name and email address in the form fields;
    they might already be filled in from what your institution provided.

1.  Click "SUBMIT".

1.  Check for an email from <registry@cilogon.org> asking you to verify your OSG registration.
    Follow the link in the email.
    You should see an "Invitation to OSG" page.

1.  Click "Accept".
    You should see a message on top saying "Petition Confirmed".

1.  Wait for approval from a COManage Admin.
    You will get an email from <registry@cilogon.org> saying "Petition for <NAME> changed status
    from Pending Approval to Approved".
    You may ignore the links in the email.

1.  To verify your access, go to
    https://registry.cilogon.org/registry/users/login
    If your registration was successful, you should see a page saying "Welcome to OSG. Please
    select an action from the menus."
    The menus are on the left.
    If you click "Groups", you will get links to see your group memberships.

    If your registration was unsuccessful, you will be at the "Self Signup With Approval" page.
    In this case, contact <help@opensciencegrid.org> for assistance.


Approving registrations (for COManage admins only)
--------------------------------------------------

1.  Check for an email from <registry@cilogon.org> saying "Petition for <NAME> changed status from
    Confirmed to Pending Approval".

1.  Click the first link in the email.

1.  Log in with your institutional credentials.
    You should see a "View CO Petition..." page.
    The Status should be "Pending Approval".

1.  Verify that the application is legitimate.

1.  Click "Approve".
    You should see "Petition Approved" and "Petition Finalized" on top.
    The Status should now be "Finalized".

1.  The user will get an email saying "Petition for <NAME> changed status from Pending Approval to
    Approved".

    The first link will give them "Permission Denied";
    the second link will take them to the notification page, which they can "acknowledge",
    but that doesn't do anything useful.
