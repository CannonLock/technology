OSG Support of the Globus Toolkit (DRAFT)
=================================
6 June 2017

Many in the OSG community have heard the news about the [end of support for the open-source Globus Toolkit](https://github.com/globus/globus-toolkit/blob/globus_6_branch/support-changes.md).

What does this imply for the OSG Software stack?  In the short-term, not much: OSG support for the Globus Toolkit will continue for as long as stakeholders need it.

The OSG Software team provides a support guarantee for all software in our stack.  This includes all phases of the software lifecycle, including end-of-life. When a software component is abandoned by its original developers, the OSG will assist its stakeholders in managing the transition.  This assistance comes in many forms, such as finding an equivalent replacement, adapting code to avoid the dependency, or helping research and develop a transition to new technology.  During the transition period, the OSG Software team will often take on the traditional upstream maintenance duties such as patching and support.

OSG is committed to keep the software secure during the transition period. 

This model has been successfully demonstrated throughout the lifetime of OSG; Globus Toolkit will not be an exception.  The primary difference is how long Globus has been in our software stack: this is both a disadvantage (larger number of dependencies) and an advantage (significant in-house expertise on the codebase).

Over the next weeks and months, we will be in contact with our stakeholder VOs, sites, and software providers for transition planning.  The OSG hopes to utilize this opportunity to modernize our software stack and transfer service.  With your collaboration, we look forward to future progress!
