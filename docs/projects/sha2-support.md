SHA-2 Compliance
================

When a certificate authority signs a certificate, it uses one of several possible hash algorithms. 
Historically, the most popular algorithms were MD5 (now retired due to security issues) and the SHA-1 family.
SHA-1 certificates are being phased out due to perceived weaknesses â€” as of February 2017, a practical attack for generating collisions was demonstrated by [Google researchers](https://shattered.io/static/shattered.pdf).
 These days, the preferred hash algorithm family is SHA-2.

The certificate authorities (CAs), which issue host and user certificates used widely in the OSG, defaulted to SHA-2-based certificates on 1 October 2013; all sites will need to make sure that their software supports certificates using the SHA-2 algorithms. All supported OSG releases support SHA-2.

The table below denotes indicates the minimum releases necessary to support SHA-2 certificates.
