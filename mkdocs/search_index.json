The validation is meant to be distributed: the VOMS client does not\n    need to contact the VOMS-Admin server.  However, OSG has historically used software\n    such as GUMS or \nedg-mkgridmap\n to cache a list of authorizations from the VOMS-Admin\n    interface, creating a dependency between VOMS client and VOMS-Admin.\n\n\n\n\nVOMS-Admin is a large, complex Java web application.  Over the last\nfew years, upstream support has tailed off - particularly as OSG has been unable\nto update to VOMS-Admin version 3.  As a result, the maintenance burden has largely\nfallen on the OSG Software team.\n\n\nGiven that VOMS-Admin is deeply tied to X509 security infrastructure - and is\nmaintenance-only from OSG Software - there is no path forward to eliminate the use\nof X509 certificates in the web browser, a high-priority goal\n\n\nIn discussions with the OSG community, we have found very few VOs utilize VOMS-Admin\nto manage their VO users.  Instead, the majority use VOMS-Admin to whitelist a pilot\ncertificate: this can be done without a VOMS-Admin endpoint.\n\n\nOSG's plans to retire VOMS-Admin has three major components:\n\n\n\n\n(Sites) Enable distributed validation of VOMS extensions in the VOMS client.\n\n\n(VOs) Migrate VOs that use VOMS only for pilot certificates to direct signing\n  of VOMS proxies.\n\n\n(VOs) Migrate remaining VOs to a central \ncomanage\n instance for managing user\n  authorizations; maintain a plugin to enable direct callouts from VOMS-Server\n  to \ncomanage\n for authorization lookups.\n\n\n\n\nSite Transition Plans\n\n\nWe will release a configuration of the LCMAPS authorization framework that performs\ndistributed verification of VOMS extensions; this verification eludes the need to\ncontact the VOMS-Admin interface for a list of authorizations.\n\n\nIn 2015/2016, LCMAPS and GUMS were upgraded so GUMS skips the VOMS-Admin lookup when\nLCMAPS asserts the validation was performed.  Hence, when GUMS sites update clients to the\nlatest (April 2017) LCMAPS and HTCondor-CE releases, the callout to VOMS-Admin is no longer\nneeded.  \nNote\n: In parallel to the VOMS-Admin transition, OSG Software plans to retire GUMS.\nThere is no need to complete one transition before the other.\n\n\nSites using \nedg-mkgridmap\n will need to use its replacement, \nlcmaps-plugins-voms\n (this\nprocess is documented elsewhere).\n\n\nVO Transition Plans\n\n\nBased on one-to-one discussions, we believe the majority of VOs only use VOMS-Admin to maintain\na list of authorized pilots.  For these VOs, we will help convert invocations of \nvoms-proxy-init\n:\n\n\nvoms-proxy-init -voms hcc:/hcc/Role=pilot\n\n\n\n\nto an equivalent call to \nvoms-proxy-fake\n:\n\n\nvoms-proxy-fake -hostcert /etc/grid-security/voms/vomscert.pem \\\n                -hostkey /etc/grid-security/voms/vomskey.pem \\\n                -fqan /hcc/Role=pilot \\\n                -voms hcc -uri hcc-voms.unl.edu:15000\n\n\n\n\nThe latter command would typically be run on the VO's glideinWMS frontend host, requiring the service certificate\ncurrently on the VOMS-Admin server to be kept on the frontend host.  The frontend's account may also need access\nto the certificate.\n\n\nWe plan to transition more complex VOs - those using VOMS-Admin to track membership in a VO - to \ncomanage\n.  It is\nnot clear there are any such VOs that need support from OSG.  If there are, a hosted version of \ncomanage\n is expected\nto be available in summer 2017 from the CILogon 2.0 project.  If you feel your VO is affected, please contact the\nOSG and we will build a custom timeline.  If there are no such VOs, we will not need to adopt \ncomanage\n for this\nuse case (other uses of \ncomanage\n are expected to proceed regardless).\n\n\nTimeline\n\n\n\n\nApril 2017 (completed): \nlcmaps-plugins-voms\n shipped and supported by OSG.\n\n\nMay 2017: \nosg-configure\n and documentation necessary for using \nlcmaps-plugins-voms\n is shipped.\n\n\nJune 2017: OSG 3.4.0 is released without VOMS-Admin, \nedg-mkgridmap\n, or GUMS.
