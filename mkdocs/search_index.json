The validation is meant to be distributed: the VOMS client does not\n    need to contact the VOMS-Admin server.  However, OSG has historically used software\n    such as GUMS or \nedg-mkgridmap\n to cache a list of authorizations from the VOMS-Admin\n    interface, creating a dependency between VOMS client and VOMS-Admin.\n\n\n\n\nVOMS-Admin is a large, complex Java web application.  Over the last\nfew years, upstream support has tailed off - particularly as OSG has been unable\nto update to VOMS-Admin version 3.  As a result, the maintenance burden has largely\nfallen on the OSG Software team.\n\n\nGiven that VOMS-Admin is deeply tied to X509 security infrastructure - and is\nmaintenance-only from OSG Software - there is no path forward to eliminate the use\nof X509 certificates in the web browser, a high-priority goal\n\n\nIn discussions with the OSG community, we have found very few VOs utilize VOMS-Admin\nto manage their VO users.

Hence, when GUMS sites update clients to the\nlatest (April 2017) LCMAPS and HTCondor-CE releases, the callout to VOMS-Admin is no longer\nneeded. \nNote\n: In parallel to the VOMS-Admin transition, OSG Software plans to \nretire GUMS\n.\nThere is no need to complete one transition before the other.\n\n\nSites using \nedg-mkgridmap\n will need to use its replacement, \nlcmaps-plugins-voms\n (this\nprocess is documented \nhere\n).\n\n\nVO Transition Plans\n\n\nBased on one-to-one discussions, we believe the majority of VOs only use VOMS-Admin to maintain\na list of authorized pilots.

The frontend's account may also need access\nto the certificate.\n\n\nWe plan to transition more complex VOs - those using VOMS-Admin to track membership in a VO - to \ncomanage\n.

Use this policy to help plan when to perform major OSG software updates at your site.\n\n\nOSG software releases are organized into \nrelease series\n, with the intent that software updates within a series do not take long to perform, cause significant downtime, or break dependent software. New series can be more disruptive, allowing OSG to add, substantially change, and remove software components. Releases are assigned versions, such as \"OSG 3.2.1\", where the first two numbers designate the release series and the third number increments within the series. Changes to the first number are infrequent and indicate sweeping changes to the way in which OSG software is distributed.\n\n\nOSG supports at most two concurrent release series, \ncurrent\n and \nprevious\n, where the goal is to begin a new release series about every 18 months. Once a new series starts, OSG will support the previous series for at least 12 months and will announce its end-of-life date at least 6 months in advance. During the first 6 months of a series, OSG will endeavor to apply backward-compatible changes to the previous series as well; afterward, OSG will apply only critical bug and security fixes. When support ends for a release series, it means that OSG no longer updates the software, fixes issues, or troubleshoots installations for releases within the series. The plan is to maintain interoperability between supported series, but there is no guarantee that unsupported series will continue to function in OSG.\n\n\nOSG Operations will handle deviations from this policy, in consultation with OSG Technology and stakeholders.\n\n\nLife-cycle Dates\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelease Series\n\n\nInitial Release\n\n\nEnd of Regular Support\n\n\nEnd of Critical Bug/Security Support\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.4\n\n\nJune 2017\n\n\nNot set\n\n\nNot set\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.3\n\n\nAugust 2015\n\n\nDecember 2017\n\n\nMay 2018\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2\n\n\nNovember 2013\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\nAugust 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1\n\n\nApril 2012\n\n\nOctober 2014\n\n\nApril 2015",
