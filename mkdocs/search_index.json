            "text": "Migrating to Markdown\n\n\nAs part of the TWiki retirement (the read-only target date of Oct 1, 2017, with a shutdown date in 2018), we will need to convert the OSG Software and Release3 docs from TWiki syntax to \nMarkdown\n. The following document outlines the conversion process and conventions.\n\n\nChoosing document locations and names\n\n\nSoftwareTeam\n documents should go into the \ntechnology github repo\n and \nRelease3\n documents should go into the \ndocs github repo\n. Document file names should be lowercase, \n-\n delimited, and descriptive but concise, e.g. \nmarkdown-migration.md\n or \ncutting-release.md\n\n\nArchiving the TWiki document\n\n\nSave the raw TWiki file into the \ndocs/archive/\n folder of your local git repository:\n\n\n[user@client ~] $\n curl \nTWIKI URL\n?raw=text\n \n|\n iconv -f windows-1252 \n docs/archive/\nTWIKI TITLE\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor example, to archive https://twiki.opensciencegrid.org/bin/view/Documentation/Release3/SHA2Compliance:\n\n\n$\n curl \nhttps://twiki.opensciencegrid.org/bin/view/Documentation/Release3/SHA2Compliance?raw=text\n \n|\n iconv -f windows-1252 \n docs/archive/SHA2Compliance\n\n\n\n\n\nInitial conversion with Pandoc\n\n\nPandoc\n is a tool that's useful for automated conversion of markdown languages. \nOnce installed\n (alternatively, run pandoc \nvia docker\n), run the following command to convert TWiki to Markdown:\n\n\n$\n pandoc -f twiki -t markdown_github \nTWIKI FILE\n \n \nMARKDOWN FILE\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere \nTWIKI FILE\n is the path to initial document in raw TWiki and \nMARKDOWN FILE\n is the path to the resulting document in GitHub Markdown.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nIf you don't see output from the above command quickly, it means that Pandoc is having an issue with a specific section of the document. Stop the command (or docker container), find and temporarily remove the offending section, convert the remainder of the document with Pandoc, and manually convert the offending section.\n\n\n\n\nUsing docker\n\n\nThe \npandoc\n library is written in Haskell and is frequently updated, meaning it may be unavailable on your distribution of choice - or too old.  If you cannot install \npandoc\n but have access to docker, you can run the following command:\n\n\ndocker run -v \n`\npwd\n`\n:/source jagregory/pandoc -f twiki -t markdown_github \nTWIKI FILE\n \n \nMARKDOWN FILE\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor example, to do a Docker-based conversion of the document at https://twiki.opensciencegrid.org/bin/view/Documentation/Release3/SHA2Compliance, one would do:\n\n\n$ mkdir -p docs/archive docs/projects\n$ curl \nhttps://twiki.opensciencegrid.org/bin/view/Documentation/Release3/SHA2Compliance?raw=text\n \n|\n iconv -f windows-1252 \n docs/archive/SHA2Compliance\n$ docker run -v \n`\npwd\n`\n/docs/:/source jagregory/pandoc -f twiki -t markdown_github /source/archive/SHA2Compliance \n docs/projects/sha2-support.md\n\n\n\n\n\nWe have found some cases where the Docker version of \npandoc\n handles Twiki syntax better than the EPEL one; YMMV.  Testing also shows that the conversion process is only about 80% accurate and each document will require a few minutes of manual touch-up.  The above example required no formatting changes.\n\n\nPreviewing your document(s) with Mkdocs\n\n\nMkdocs\n has a development mode that can be used to preview documents as you work on them and is available via package manager or \npip\n. \nOnce installed\n, add your document(s) to the \npages\n section of \nmkdocs.yml\n and launch the mkdocs server with the following command from the dir containing \nmkdocs.yml\n:\n\n\n$\n \nPYTHONPATH\n=\nsrc/ mkdocs serve\n\n\n\n\n\nAccess the server at \nhttp://127.0.0.1:8000\n and navigate to the document you're working on. It's useful to open the original TWiki doc in an adjacent tab or window to quickly compare the two.\n\n\nThings to watch out for\n\n\nBroken links\n\n\nPandoc isn't aware of the entire TWiki structure so internal links using \nWikiWords\n result in broken links. If the broken link is for a document that has already been migrated to GitHub, link to it using relative paths to the markdown doc of interest. If the broken link is for a document that hasn't been migrated to GitHub, consult the documentation spreadsheet (contact Brian L for access) to see if it's targeted for archival.\n\n\nIf the broken link is:\n\n\n\n\nFor a document that has already been migrated to GitHub, update it to point at the new location.\n\n\nFor a document that not been migrated to GitHub, consult the documentation spreadsheet (contact Brian L for access):\n   a. If the link is targeted for archival, remove the link if it makes sense. If you're unsure, be sure to mention it in your final pull request\n   b. If the link is not targeted for archival, link directly to the TWiki page.\n\n\n\n\nBroken command blocks and file snippets\n\n\nPandoc doesn't do a good job of converting our \npre class=...\n blocks so manual intervention is required. Command blocks and file snippets should be wrapped in three backticks (```) followed by an optional code highlighting format:\n\n\n```python\n# stuff\n```\n\n\n\n\n\nMake sure to use the TWiki document as a reference when making fixes!\n\n\nWe use the \nPygments\n highlighting library for syntax; it knows about 100 different languages.  The Pygments website contains a live renderer if you want to see how your text will come out.  Please use the \nconsole\n language for shell sessions.\n\n\nFixing root and user prompts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFind and replace...\n\n\nWith...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nspan class=\"twiki-macro UCL\\_PROMPT\\_ROOT\"\n/span\n\n\n[root@client ~] #\n\n\n\n\n\n\nspan class=\"twiki-macro UCL\\_PROMPT\"\n/span\n\n\n[user@client ~] $\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHighlighting user input\n\n\nWithin command blocks and file snippets, we've used \n%RED%...%ENDCOLOR%\n, \nlt;...\ngt;\n, etc. to highlight areas that users would have to insert text specific to their site. For now, use desciptive, all-caps text wrapped in angle brackets to indicate user input:\n\n\n[root@client ~]#\n condor_ce_trace -d \nCE HOSTNAME\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOrdered Lists\n\n\nOrdered lists are often broken up into multiple lists if there are command blocks/file snippets and/or additional text within one of the list items. To make sure the contents of an item are indented properly, use the following formatting:\n\n\n\n\nFor code blocks or file snippets, add an empty line after any regular text, then insert \n(N+1)*4\n spaces at the beginning of each line, where N is the level of the item in the list. To apply code highlighting, start the code block with \n:::\nFORMAT\n; see \nthis page\n for details, including possible highlighting formats.  For an example of formatting a code section inside a list, see \nthe release series document\n.\n\n\nFor additional text (i.e. after a code block), insert \nN*4\n spaces at the beginning of each line, where N is the level of the item in the list.\n\n\n\n\nFor example:\n\n\n1. Foo\n    - Bar\n\n            :::console\n            COMMAND\n            BLOCK\n        text associated with Bar\n\n    text associated with Foo\n\n2. Baz\n\n        FILE\n        SNIPPET\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are 12 spaces and 8 spaces in front of the command block and text associated with \nBar\n, respectively; 4 spaces in front of the text associated with \nFoo\n; and 8 spaces in front of the file snippet associated with \nBaz\n.  The above block is rendered below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFoo\n\n\n\n\nBar\nCOMMAND\n\n\nBLOCK\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntext associated with Bar\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntext associated with Foo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBaz\n\n\nFILE\nSNIPPET\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nTo catch the user's attention for important items or pitfalls, we used \n%NOTE%\n TWiki macros, these can be replaced with admonition-style notes:\n\n\n!!! note\n    # things to note\n\n\n\n\n\nThe above block is rendered below as an example.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nthings to note\n\n\n\n\nObvious errors\n\n\nIf you see any other obvious errors (e.g., links to gratia web), feel free to correct them while you're editing the doc \niff\n the changes take less than ~15 minutes. This isn't a renovation project!\n\n\nMaking the pull request\n\n\n\n\nCreate a branch based off of master\n\n\nAdd page to \nmkdocs.yml\n in \ntitle case\n, e.g. \nMigrating Documents to Markdown\n\n\ngit add\n the archived raw TWiki and the converted Markdown document(s)\n\n\ngit commit\n your changes and \ngit push\n to your GH repo\n\n\nMake PR containing the following tasks in the body:\nLINK TO TWIKI DOCUMENT\n\n\n- [ ] Enter date into \nMigrated\n column of google sheet\n- [ ] Add migration header to TWiki document\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee an example pull request \nhere\n.\n\n\nAdding a header to the TWiki document\n\n\nAfter completing the migration of a document, replace the contents of TWiki document with the following header, linking to the location of the migrated document:\n\n\ndiv\n \nstyle=\nborder: 1px solid black; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em; background-color: #FFDDDD; font-weight: 600;\n\nThis is an archive, find the new version of this document [[LINK TO GITHUB DOCUMENT][here]].\n\nBackground:\n\nAt the end of year (2017), the TWiki will be retired in favor of !GitHub. You can find the various TWiki webs and their new !GitHub locations listed below:\n\n   * Release3: https://opensciencegrid.github.io/docs\n   * !SoftwareTeam: https://opensciencegrid.github.io/technology\n\n/div\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce the header has been added, go back to your pull request and mark that task as complete:\n\n\n- [X] Add migration header to TWiki document\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrently, we do not recommend changing backlinks (links on other twiki pages that refer to the Twiki page you are migrating) to point at the new GitHub URL.  This is to provide a simple reminder to users that the migration will occur, and also is likely low priority regardless as all pages will eventually migrate to GitHub.  This advice may change in the future as we gain experience with this transition.\n\n\nReviewing pull requests\n\n\nTo review pull requests, \ncd\n into the dir containing your git repository, check out the requester's branch, and start a local \nmkdocs\n server. Here's an example checking out Brian's \ncut-sw-release\n branch of the technology repository:\n\n\n#\n Add the requester\ns repo as a remote if you haven\nt already\n\n[user@client ~ ] $\n git remote add blin https://www.github.com/brianhlin/technology.git\n\n[user@client ~ ] $\n git fetch --all\n\n[user@client ~ ] $\n git checkout blin/cut-sw-release\n\n[user@client ~ ] $\n \nPYTHONPATH\n=\nsrc/ mkdocs serve\n\n\n\n\n\nAccess the server at \nhttp://127.0.0.1:8000\n and navigate to the document in the request.",

This is done by finding the package differences between osg-testing and the current release.\n\n\nStep 1: Update the osg-version RPM\n\n\nFor each release (excluding upcoming), update the version number in the osg-version RPM's spec file and build it in koji:\n\n\n#\n If building \nfor\n the latest release out of trunk\n\n[user@client ~] $\n osg-build koji osg-version\n\n#\n If building \nfor\n an older release out of a branch:\n\n[user@client ~] $\n osg-build koji --repo\n=\nMAJOR VERSION\n osg-version\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere \nMAJOR VERSION\n is of the format \nx.y\n (e.g. \n3.2\n).\n\n\nStep 2: Promote osg-version and generate the release list\n\n\nRun \n0-generate-pkg-list\n from a machine that has your koji-registered user certificate:\n\n\n[user@client ~] $\n git clone https://github.com/opensciencegrid/release-tools.git\n\n[user@client ~] $\n \ncd\n release-tools\n\n[user@client ~] $\n \n0\n-generate-pkg-list \nVERSION\n(\nS\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDay 1: Verify Pre-Release and Generate Tarballs\n\n\nThis section is to be performed 1-2 days before the release (as designated by the release manager) to perform last checks of the release and create the client tarballs.\n\n\nStep 1: Verify Pre-Release\n\n\nCompare the list of packages already in pre-release to the final list for the release put together by the OSG Release Coordinator (who should have updated \nrelease-list\n in git).

Make sure \nosgrun osg-version\n works by running the following tests, replacing \nNON-UPCOMING VERSION(S)\n with the appropriate version numbers:\n\n\ndotest \n()\n \n{\n\n    \nfile\n=\n$dir\n/\n$client\n-\n$ver\n-1.\n$rhel\n.\n$arch\n.tar.gz\n    mkdir -p \n$rhel\n-\n$arch\n\n    \npushd\n \n$rhel\n-\n$arch\n\n    tar xzf ../\n$file\n\n    \n$client\n/osg/osg-post-install\n    \n$client\n/osgrun osg-version\n    \npopd\n\n    rm -rf \n$rhel\n-\n$arch\n\n\n}\n\n\n\npushd\n /tmp\n\n\nfor\n client in osg-afs-client osg-wn-client\n;\n \ndo\n\n    \nfor\n ver in \nNON-UPCOMING VERSION\n(\nS\n)\n;\n \ndo\n\n        \nfor\n rhel in el6 el7\n;\n \ndo\n\n            \narch\n=\nx86_64\n            \ndir\n=\ntarballs/\n${\nver\n%.*\n}\n/\n$arch\n\n            dotest\n        \ndone\n\n    \ndone\n\n\ndone\n\n\n\nclient\n=\nosg-wn-client\n\narch\n=\ni386\n\nrhel\n=\nel6\n\nfor\n ver in \nNON-UPCOMING VERSION\n(\nS\n)\n;\n \ndo\n\n    \ndir\n=\ntarballs/\n${\nver\n%.*\n}\n/\n$arch\n\n    dotest\n\ndone\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you have time, try some of the binaries, such as grid-proxy-init.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nWe need to automate this and have it run on the proper architectures and version of RHEL.\n\n\n\n\nStep 6: Update the UW AFS installation of the tarball client\n\n\nThe UW keeps an install of the tarball client in \n/p/vdt/workspace/tarball-client\n on the UW's AFS. To update it, run the following commands:\n\n\nfor\n ver in \nNON-UPCOMING VERSION\n(\nS\n)\n;\n \ndo\n\n    /p/vdt/workspace/tarball-client/afs-install-tarball-client \n$ver\n\n\ndone\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 7: Wait\n\n\nWait for clearance. The OSG Release Coordinator (in consultation with the Software Team and any testers) need to sign off on the update before it is released. If you are releasing things over two days, this is a good place to stop for the day.\n\n\nDay 2: Pushing the Release\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nFor the second phase of the release, try to complete it earlier in the day rather than later. The GOC would like to send out the release announcement prior to 3 p.m. Eastern time.\n\n\n\n\nStep 1: Push from pre-release to release\n\n\nThis script moves the packages into release, clones releases into new version-specific release repos, locks the repos and regenerates them. Afterwards, it produces \n*release-note*\n files that should be used to update the release note pages. Clone it from the github repo and run the script:\n\n\n[user@client ~] $\n \n2\n-create-release \nVERSION\n(\nS\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*.txt\n files are also created and it should be verified that they've been moved to /p/vdt/public/html/release-info/ on UW's AFS.\n\n\nFor each release version, use the \n*release-note*\n files to update the relevant sections of the release note pages.\n\n\n\n\nStep 2: Upload the client tarballs\n\n\nAsk Tim Theisen, Brian Lin, or someone with privileges on the \ngrid.iu.edu\n repo servers to upload the tarballs with the following procedure:\n\n\nOn a CS machine\n\n\nfor\n ver in \nNON-UPCOMING VERSION\n(\nS\n)\n;\n \ndo\n\n    \nmajor_ver\n=\n`\nsed \ns/.[0-9]*$//\n \n \n$ver\n`\n\n    \ncd\n /p/vdt/public/html/tarball-client\n    ssh jump.grid.iu.edu mkdir /tmp/\n$ver\n/\n    scp -p \n$major_ver\n/*/osg-wn-client-\n$ver\n*gz jump.grid.iu.edu:/tmp/\n$ver\n/\n\ndone\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn jump.grid.iu.edu\n\n\nfor\n ver in \nNON-UPCOMING VERSION\n(\nS\n)\n;\n \ndo\n\n    scp -pr /tmp/\n$ver\n repo1:/tmp/\n    scp -pr /tmp/\n$ver\n repo2:/tmp/\n    rm -rf /tmp/\n$ver\n\n\ndone\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn repo1/repo2 (as root)\n\n\nYou can ssh to repo1 and repo2 from jump.grid.iu.edu; you will need to do this procedure on both systems.\n\n\nsudo su -\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfor\n ver in \nNON-UPCOMING VERSION\n(\nS\n)\n;\n \ndo\n\n    \nmajor_ver\n=\n`\nsed \ns/.[0-9]*$//\n \n \n$ver\n`\n\n    mv /tmp/\n$ver\n /usr/local/repo/tarball-install/\n$major_ver\n/\n    rm -f /usr/local/repo/tarball-install/\n$major_ver\n/*latest*\n\ndone\n\n/root/mk-sims.sh\n\nfor\n ver in \nNON-UPCOMING VERSION\n(\nS\n)\n;\n \ndo\n\n    \nmajor_ver\n=\n`\nsed \ns/.[0-9]*$//\n \n \n$ver\n`\n\n    ls -l /usr/local/repo/tarball-install/\n$major_ver\n/*latest* \n# verify the symlinks are correct\n\n\ndone\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 3: Install the tarballs into OASIS\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nYou must be an OASIS manager of the \nmis\n VO to do these steps. Known managers as of 2014-07-22: Mat, Tim C, Tim T, Brian L. \n\n\n\n\nGet the uploader script from Git and run it with \nosgrun\n from the UW AFS install of the tarball client you made earlier. On a UW CSL machine:\n\n\ncd\n /tmp\ngit clone --depth \n1\n file:///p/vdt/workspace/git/repo/tarball-client.git\n\nfor\n ver in \nNON-UPCOMING VERSION\n(\nS\n)\n;\n \ndo\n\n    /p/vdt/workspace/tarball-client/current/sys/osgrun /tmp/tarball-client/upload-tarballs-to-oasis \n$ver\n\n\ndone\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe script will automatically ssh you to oasis-login.opensciencegrid.org and give you instructions to complete the process.\n\n\nStep 4: Remove old UW AFS installations of the tarball client\n\n\nTo keep space usage down, remove tarball client installations and symlinks under \n/p/vdt/workspace/tarball-client\n on UW's AFS that are more than 2 months old. The following command will remove them:\n\n\n[user@client ~] $\n find /p/vdt/workspace/tarball-client -maxdepth \n1\n -mtime +60 -name \n3\n\\*\n -ls -exec rm -rf \n{}\n \n\\;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 5: Update the Docker WN client\n\n\nUpdate the GitHub repo at \nopensciencegrid/docker-osg-wn\n using the \nupdate-all\n script found in \nopensciencegrid/docker-osg-wn-scripts\n. This requires push access to the \nopensciencegrid/docker-osg-wn\n repo.\n\n\nInstructions for using the script:\n\n\ngit clone git@github.com:opensciencegrid/docker-osg-wn-scripts.git\n\n\ngit clone git@github.com:opensciencegrid/docker-osg-wn.git\n\n\ndocker-osg-wn-scripts/update-all docker-osg-wn\n\n\ncd docker-osg-wn\n\n\n#\n Verify everything looks fine and run the \ngit push\n \ncommand\n\n\n#\n that \nupdate-all\n should have printed\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 6: Announce the release\n\n\nThe following instructions are meant for the release manager (or interim release manager). If you are not the release manager, let the release manager know that they can announce the release.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe release manager writes the release announcement and send it out. Here is a sample, replace \nHIGHLIGHTED TEXT\n with the appropriate values:\n\n\n Subject: Announcing OSG Software version \nVERSION(S)\n\n\n We are pleased to announce OSG Software version \nVERSION(S)\n!\n\n This is the new OSG Software distributed via RPMs for:\n\n * Scientific Linux 6 and 7\n * CentOS 6 and 7\n * Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7\n\n This release affects the \nSET OF METAPACKAGES (client, compute element, etc...)\n. Changes include:\n\n * Major change 1\n * Major change 2\n * Major change 3\n\n Release notes and pointers to more documentation can be found at:\n\n \nLINK TO RELEASE NOTES\n\n\n Need help? Let us know:\n\n https://www.opensciencegrid.org/bin/view/Documentation/Release3/HelpProcedure\n\n We welcome feedback on this release\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe release manager emails the announcement to \nvdt-discuss@opensciencegrid.org\n\n\n\n\nThe release manager asks the GOC to distribute the announcement by \nopening a ticket\n\n\nThe release manager closes the tickets marked 'Ready for Release' in the release's JIRA filter using the 'bulk change' function. Uncheck the box that reads \"Send mail for this update\"\n\n\nThe release manager updates the recent/scheduled release tables on the Software/Release \nhomepage",

This is done by finding the package differences between osg-testing and the current release. Run \n0-generate-pkg-list\n from a machine that has your koji-registered user certificate:\n\n\n[user@client ~] $\n git clone https://github.com/opensciencegrid/release-tools.git\n\n[user@client ~] $\n \ncd\n release-tools\n\n[user@client ~] $\n \n0\n-generate-pkg-list -d \nREVISION\n \nVERSION\n(\nS\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDay 1: Verify Pre-Release\n\n\nThis section is to be performed 1-2 days before the release (as designated by the release manager) to perform last checks of the release.\n\n\nCompare the list of packages already in pre-release to the final list for the release put together by the OSG Release Coordinator (who should have updated \nrelease-list\n in git).

The GOC would like to send out the release announcement prior to 3 p.m. Eastern time.\n\n\nStep 1: Push from pre-release to release\n\n\nThis script moves the packages into release, clones releases into new version-specific release repos, locks the repos and regenerates them. Afterwards, it produces \n*release-note*\n files that should be used to update the release note pages.

The repository is checked every 10 minutes for update CA certificates. Then, run the following command to update the VO Package and/or CA certificates in the tarball installations and verify that the version of the VO Package and/or CA certificates match the version that was promoted to release.\n\n\n[user@client ~] $\n /p/vdt/workspace/tarball-client/current/amd64_rhel6/osgrun osg-update-data\n\n[user@client ~] $\n /p/vdt/workspace/tarball-client/current/amd64_rhel7/osgrun osg-update-data\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 4: Announce the release\n\n\nThe following instructions are meant for the release manager (or interim release manager).

The validation is meant to be distributed: the VOMS client does not\n    need to contact the VOMS-Admin server.  However, OSG has historically used software\n    such as GUMS or \nedg-mkgridmap\n to cache a list of authorizations from the VOMS-Admin\n    interface, creating a dependency between VOMS client and VOMS-Admin.\n\n\n\n\nVOMS-Admin is a large, complex Java web application.  Over the last\nfew years, upstream support has tailed off - particularly as OSG has been unable\nto update to VOMS-Admin version 3.  As a result, the maintenance burden has largely\nfallen on the OSG Software team.\n\n\nGiven that VOMS-Admin is deeply tied to X509 security infrastructure - and is\nmaintenance-only from OSG Software - there is no path forward to eliminate the use\nof X509 certificates in the web browser, a high-priority goal\n\n\nIn discussions with the OSG community, we have found very few VOs utilize VOMS-Admin\nto manage their VO users.  Instead, the majority use VOMS-Admin to whitelist a pilot\ncertificate: this can be done without a VOMS-Admin endpoint.\n\n\nOSG's plans to retire VOMS-Admin has three major components:\n\n\n\n\n(Sites) Enable distributed validation of VOMS extensions in the VOMS client.\n\n\n(VOs) Migrate VOs that use VOMS only for pilot certificates to direct signing\n  of VOMS proxies.\n\n\n(VOs) Migrate remaining VOs to a central \ncomanage\n instance for managing user\n  authorizations; maintain a plugin to enable direct callouts from VOMS-Server\n  to \ncomanage\n for authorization lookups.\n\n\n\n\nSite Transition Plans\n\n\nWe will release a configuration of the LCMAPS authorization framework that performs\ndistributed verification of VOMS extensions; this verification eludes the need to\ncontact the VOMS-Admin interface for a list of authorizations.\n\n\nIn 2015/2016, LCMAPS and GUMS were upgraded so GUMS skips the VOMS-Admin lookup when\nLCMAPS asserts the validation was performed.  Hence, when GUMS sites update clients to the\nlatest (April 2017) LCMAPS and HTCondor-CE releases, the callout to VOMS-Admin is no longer\nneeded. \nNote\n: In parallel to the VOMS-Admin transition, OSG Software plans to \nretire GUMS\n.\nThere is no need to complete one transition before the other.\n\n\nSites using \nedg-mkgridmap\n will need to use its replacement, \nlcmaps-plugins-voms\n (this\nprocess is documented \nhere\n).\n\n\nVO Transition Plans\n\n\nBased on one-to-one discussions, we believe the majority of VOs only use VOMS-Admin to maintain\na list of authorized pilots.  For these VOs, we will help convert invocations of \nvoms-proxy-init\n:\n\n\nvoms-proxy-init -voms hcc:/hcc/Role=pilot\n\n\n\n\n\nto an equivalent call to \nvoms-proxy-fake\n:\n\n\nvoms-proxy-fake -hostcert /etc/grid-security/voms/vomscert.pem \\\n                -hostkey /etc/grid-security/voms/vomskey.pem \\\n                -fqan /hcc/Role=pilot \\\n                -voms hcc -uri hcc-voms.unl.edu:15000\n\n\n\n\n\nThe latter command would typically be run on the VO's glideinWMS frontend host, requiring the service certificate\ncurrently on the VOMS-Admin server to be kept on the frontend host.  The frontend's account may also need access\nto the certificate.\n\n\nWe plan to transition more complex VOs - those using VOMS-Admin to track membership in a VO - to \ncomanage\n.  It is\nnot clear there are any such VOs that need support from OSG.  If there are, a hosted version of \ncomanage\n is expected\nto be available in summer 2017 from the CILogon 2.0 project.

The EL5 and EL6 tags also contain the \njpackage[56]-bin\n external repos under \nhttp://mirror.batlab.org/pub/jpackage/\n since we use those for some builds.\n\n\nNote\n that the JPackage external repos must have a better priority than the OS and EPEL external repos to avoid build problems for Java packages.\n\n\nosg-upcoming-el[567]-build\n\n\nTag list\n\n\nThese tags are special in that they also need to inherit from the latest mainline osg-build repo (that is, if trunk is 3.3, then \nosg-upcoming-el6-build\n should inherit from \nosg-3.3-el6-build\n).\n\n\nosg-*-el[567]-development\n\n\nTag list\n\n\nThese contain the builds in the \nosg-minefield\n repos. The \nosg-development\n repos hosted by the GOC take packages from this, so \nosg-development\n is pretty much \nosg-minefield\n after a 1-hour delay. They inherit from osg-testing (and occasionally from the more specialized branches like el5-gt52-experimental, though that is now discouraged). Builds that are made using the \nosg-el[567]\n targets (default if you're using \nosg-build\n) get their buildroots from the newest osg-build tags and put their results in the newest osg-development tags.\n\n\nosg-*-el[567]-testing\n\n\nTag list\n\n\nThese contain the builds in the \nosg-testing\n repos. They inherit from the respective \nosg-release\n tags.\n\n\nosg-*-el[567]-prerelease\n\n\nTag list\n\n\nThese are a staging are for packages that we are \ncertain\n will be released in the next release. They are otherwise empty. These are used for testing and for building the tarball clients.\n\n\nosg-*-el[567]-release\n\n\nTag list\n\n\nThese contain the builds in the \nosg-release\n repos. They should be locked except for when moving packages from the \nosg-prerelease\n repos to the \nosg-release\n repos. They inherit from \nosg-el[567]\n.\n\n\nosg-3.[123]-el[567]-release-build\n\n\nTag list\n\n\nThese inherit the \ndist-*-build\n tags and the \nosg-*-release\n tags, putting a base OS along with OSG packages in a single repo, without the need for yum priorities. It is used, along with \nosg-*-prerelease\n, for building the tarball client. Note that there are no \nrelease-build\n repos for upcoming.\n\n\nosg-3.[123]-el[567]-contrib\n\n\nTag list\n\n\nThese contain the builds in the \nosg-contrib\n repos. Note that there are no \nosg-upcoming-contrib\n repos.\n\n\nSpecialized tags\n\n\nThese tags are generally made for long projects which may be in an unstable state and should not interfere with the main development of OSG packages. An example is a full-scale Globus update, where many packages have to be built, using each other as dependencies, and the whole system is not considered usable until all the updates are done. They should generally be removed after the work is done.\n\n\nel5-pegasus and el5-pegasus-build\n\n\nThese tags were made for Mats Rynge of the Pegasus project to build into.\n\n\nel5-lcmaps-upgrade and el5-lcmaps-upgrade-build\n\n\nThese tags were made for Dave Dykstra to build into.\n\n\nel[56]-condor-unified-development and el[56]-condor-unified-development-build\n\n\nThese tags were made for Carl Edquist's work on the unified HTCondor RPM.\n\n\nCollaborator Tags\n\n\nhcc-*\n\n\nFor use by the Holland Computing Center at UNL.\n\n\nuscms-*\n\n\nFor use by US CMS.\n\n\nBuild Targets\n\n\nA koji \ntarget\n pairs a build tag (which contains packages needed to build software) and a destination tag (which the software will be tagged into once it is built).\n\n\nosg-el[567]\n\n\nThese build from the osg-*-el[567]-build tags for the current release series into the osg-*-el[567]-development tags and are the primary targets used for building OSG software.\n\n\nosg-3.[123]-el[567]\n\n\nThese build from the osg-*-el[567]-build tags into the osg-*-el[567]-development tags and are used for building to releases other than the current one.\n\n\nosg-upcoming-el[567]\n\n\nThese build from the osg-upcoming-el[567]-build tags into the osg-upcoming-el[567]-development tags and are used for building to upcoming.\n\n\ndist-el[567]-build\n\n\nThese build from the \ndist-el*-build\n tag directly into the \ndist-el*-build\n tag. It is used for making builds that should be in every buildroot.\n\n\nkojira-fake-*\n\n\nThese fool kojira into regenerating their build tags as repos we can yum install from. Without this, the osg-development tags (for example) wouldn't get regenerated and osg-minefield wouldn't work.\n\n\nhcc-el[567], perfsonar-el[56], uscms-el[56], panda-el6\n\n\nThese were made for builds made for our collaborators to build into their tags.\n\n\nSigning plugin\n\n\nThe signing plugin is used to sign packages right after they are built. We give it a GPG signing key and corresponding passphrase. It is configured per build tag. The current default is to use the OSG key to sign if a configuration is not specified. This is because it's very difficult to sign packages after the fact, so it's better to erroneously sign some of them with the wrong key than to not sign them.\n\n\nIt is therefore important that whenever a new build tag is created, a corresponding config section for the signing plugin is added, too.\n\n\nThis comes from the package \nkoji-plugin-sign\n and has configs in \n/etc/koji-sign-plugin\n and \n/etc/koji-hub/plugins\n. There is a script called \nfix-permissions\n in both directories that will make sure the plugin can read the config.\n\n\nTweaks\n\n\nThese are local config changes we needed to make to get certain features to work.\n\n\nUsing proxy certs\n\n\n/etc/sysconfig/httpd\n needed to be changed to include the following lines:\n\n\nOPENSSL_ALLOW_PROXY=1\nOPENSSL_ALLOW_PROXY_CERTS=1\n\nexport OPENSSL_ALLOW_PROXY\nexport OPENSSL_ALLOW_PROXY_CERTS\n\n\n\n\n\nThe user must use RFC proxies and must have a version of the koji client of 1.6.0-6.osg or newer.\n\n\nProcedures\n\n\nUser cert switch\n\n\nThe following steps need to be taken for someone replacing their user cert:\n\n\n\n\nAn admin should log in to the database and update the \nusers\n table with their new CN.\n\n\nThe user should import their new cert into their browser and rerun \nosg-koji setup\n to fix their \nclient.crt\n.\n\n\nIf the user gets a Python stack trace when connecting to \nkoji.chtc.wisc.edu\n via their browser, they should clear their cookies.\n\n\n\n\nAdding CAs for user authentication\n\n\nSince our Koji instance uses certs for auth, we specify which CAs we trust for signing user certs. The CA certs for user auth are concatenated together in the file \n/etc/pki/tls/certs/allowed-cas-for-users.crt\n. A comment line before the \nBEGIN CERTIFICATE\n line is used to name the file the cert comes from. We take the certs from the \nosg-ca-certs\n repository.\n\n\nFor example, when I added the CERN CAs to the bundle, I installed osg-ca-certs onto a Fermicloud VM, copied \n/etc/grid-security/certificates/CERN-TCA.pem\n (which signed user certs) and \nCERN-Root.pem\n (which signed \nCERN-TCA.pem\n) to \nkoji.chtc.wisc.edu\n, catted them to the end of the \nallowed-cas-for-users.crt\n file, edited the file to add comments before the certs, and restarted \nhttpd\n.\n\n\nA few tidbits of knowledge for administrators of our Koji server:\n\n\n\n\nThree services need to be running for koji-hub to be functioning: kojira, kojid, and the Apache web server. To restart these:\n\n\nservice kojid restart\n\n\nservice kojira restart\n\n\nservice httpd restart\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLogfiles can be found here:\n\n\n/var/log/kojid.log\n\n\n/var/log/kojira.log\n\n\n/var/log/messages\n\n\n\n\n\n\nkojid is configured to stop starting new tasks if it has less than 8GB free.\n\n\nFailed build roots are kept for 4 hours, and each build root is about 1GB currently. Hence, if too many tasks fail, the kojid might stop accepting new tasks for 4 hours.\n\n\nManually clean these out.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKoji Permissions\n\n\nTo add a new user to Koji for someone with a given DN, first extract the CN. For example, Alain has the DN \n/DC=org/DC=doegrids/OU=People/CN=Alain Roy 424511\n, and the CN is just \nAlain Roy 424511\n. The commands below use just the CN.\n\n\n[you@client ~]$\n osg-koji add-user \nCN\n\n\n[you@client ~]$\n osg-koji grant-permission build \nCN\n\n\n[you@client ~]$\n osg-koji grant-permission repo \nCN\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to see the set of possible permissions:\n\n\n[you@client ~]$\n koji list-permissions \n\nEnter PEM pass phrase: \n\n\nadmin\n\n\nbuild\n\n\nrepo\n\n\nlivecd\n\n\nmaven-import\n\n\nwin-import\n\n\nwin-admin\n\n\nappliance\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to see someone's permissions:\n\n\n[you@client ~]$\n koji list-permissions --user \nAlain Roy 424511\n\n\nEnter PEM pass phrase: \n\n\nadmin\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to see your own permissions:\n\n\n[you@client ~]$\n koji list-permissions --mine\n\nEnter PEM pass phrase: \n\n\nadmin\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo see the list of users, go to the \nKoji web site\n.\n\n\nRenewing host and service certs\n\n\nCerts and keys are stored in \n/p/condor/home/certificates/...\n\n\nTo obtain renewed certificates, use \nthe OSG PKI commandline clients\n or the web interface at \nhttps://oim.grid.iu.edu/oim/certificaterequesthost\n.\n\n\nThe following cert files are necessary:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhostcert.pem\n\n\nkoji.chtc host cert (\nCN=koji.chtc.wisc.edu\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhostkey.pem\n\n\nkoji.chtc host key\n\n\n\n\n\n\nkojiracert.pem\n\n\nkoji.chtc/kojira service cert (\nCN=koji.chtc.wisc.edu/kojira\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nkojirakey.pem\n\n\nkoji.chtc/kojira service key\n\n\n\n\n\n\nkojiweb.pem\n\n\nConcatenation of \nhostcert.pem\n and \nhostkey.pem\n\n\n\n\n\n\nkojira.pem\n\n\nConcatenation of \nkojiracert.pem\n and \nkojirakey.pem\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo create \nkojiweb.pem\n and \nkojira.pem\n from their respective cert/key files, do:\n\n\n[root@koji ~]#\n \n(\ndos2unix \n hostcert.pem\n;\n echo\n;\n dos2unix \n hostkey.pem\n)\n \n kojiweb.pem\n\n[root@koji ~]#\n chmod \n0600\n kojiweb.pem\n\n[root@koji ~]#\n \n(\ndos2unix \n kojiracert.pem\n;\n echo\n;\n dos2unix \n kojirakey.pem\n)\n \n kojira.pem\n\n[root@koji ~]#\n chmod \n0600\n kojira.pem\n\n\n\n\n\nAs \nroot\n in \n/etc\n on \nkoji.chtc.wisc.edu\n:\n\n\n\n\nRun \ngit status\n.\n\n\nRun \netckeeper commit\n to commit any uncommited changes (including unversioned files).\n\n\n\n\nPut the files onto \nkoji.chtc.wisc.edu\n as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFile\n\n\nLocation\n\n\nchown\n\n\nchmod\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhostcert.pem\n\n\n/etc/pki/tls/certs/hostcert.pem\n\n\nroot:root\n\n\n0644\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhostkey.pem\n\n\n/etc/pki/tls/private/hostkey.pem\n\n\nroot:root\n\n\n0600\n\n\n\n\n\n\nkojiweb.pem\n\n\n/etc/pki/tls/private/kojiweb.pem\n\n\napache:apache\n\n\n0600\n\n\n\n\n\n\nkojira.pem\n\n\n/etc/pki/tls/private/kojira.pem\n\n\nroot:root\n\n\n0600\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShut down \nkojira\n and \nkojid\n.\n\n\nRestart \nhttpd\n.\n\n\nLog in via your own cert to the web interface to verify that it is working.\n\n\nRun \nosg-koji list-permissions --mine\n to verify command-line access is working.\n\n\nRun \netckeeper commit\n to commit your changes in \n/etc\n.\n\n\nStart up \nkojira\n and \nkojid\n.",

This is because it's very difficult to sign packages after the fact, so it's better to erroneously sign some of them with the wrong key than to not sign them.  It is therefore important that whenever a new build tag is created, a corresponding config section for the signing plugin is added, too.  This comes from the package  koji-plugin-sign  and has configs in  /etc/koji-sign-plugin  and  /etc/koji-hub/plugins .
